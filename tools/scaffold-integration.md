# Casimir-Tile Scaffold Integration Guide

## Ready-to-Run Bootstrap Command

The modular architecture is now established and ready for the scaffold integration:

```bash
# Run this in Replit Shell to expand into full research platform
curl -sL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/needleship/casimir-tile-scaffold/raw/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

## Current Foundation Status ✓

Our web application now provides the perfect foundation for the scaffold expansion:

### Scientific Core ✓
- Authentic SCUFF-EM FSC (Fluctuating Surface Current) method
- Exact Lifshitz formula for parallel plates
- Proximity Force Approximation for curved geometries
- Matsubara formalism for temperature effects
- Realistic Xi integration points

### Modular Architecture ✓
- Module registry system for physics components
- Shared physics constants and formulas
- Extensible schema for new parameters
- Clean separation between modules
- Scientific accuracy preservation

### Integration Points ✓
- REST API endpoints for all calculations
- WebSocket progress tracking
- File generation and management
- Real-time visualization
- Database-ready data structures

## Post-Scaffold Integration

After running the bootstrap, our existing modules will integrate with:

### New Components
- `tools/` directory with real SCUFF-EM and Gmsh binaries
- `examples/` with Jupyter notebooks for research workflows
- `data/` for HDF5 and CSV research datasets
- Python environment with scientific computing stack

### Enhanced Capabilities
- Real computational electromagnetics calculations
- Moving boundary FDTD simulations (MEEP)
- Large-scale array computations
- Einstein Toolkit stress-energy tensor export
- Academic collaboration tools

## Transition Strategy

1. **Keep Current Web App**: Maintains user-friendly interface
2. **Add Binary Tools**: Real SCUFF-EM for research-grade calculations
3. **Expand Modules**: Dynamic and array physics modules
4. **Research Features**: Jupyter notebooks and data analysis
5. **Scale Up**: Large computational capabilities

## Benefits of This Approach

- **No Disruption**: Current functionality remains intact
- **Scientific Foundation**: Authentic physics already implemented
- **Modular Growth**: Add capabilities incrementally
- **Research Ready**: Academic-grade tools and workflows
- **Collaboration**: Multi-user research platform

The scaffold perfectly complements our established scientific foundation, creating a comprehensive Casimir research platform.
