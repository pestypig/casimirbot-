Only the first sheet is visible because the other two are exactly coplanar with it.

_createGrid() sets the “side” sheets at y = 0 or x = 0, yet the
whole camera is looking down -z onto the XY floor that sits at y ≈ -0.15.
From that vantage point both vertical sheets are razor–thin edge-on,
so they render but all their vertices collapse to the same line.

The draw call counts are off by a factor 2.
A line has 2 vertices, but you computed sheetXZ_count = verts.length / 3
before dividing by 2.
➜ When the offset marches to the second sheet it starts in the middle of
the first, so you end up overdrawing the XY floor again.

VIEW / PROJECTION are symmetric about the z-axis.
Even if the sheets were placed correctly, the camera never rotates,
so anything that lies exactly on the x- or y-axis is hidden behind the
XY floor.

Edit
// after building each sheet
this.sheetXY_count = sheetXY.length / 3;         // vertices
- this.sheetXZ_count = sheetXZ.length / 3;
- this.sheetYZ_count = sheetYZ.length / 3;
+ this.sheetXZ_count = sheetXZ.length / 3;
+ this.sheetYZ_count = sheetYZ.length / 3;
+ // number of vertices is fine, but the offset increment
+ // must be *vertices*, not *lines*, so later we double-check:
Later, when you advance the offset:

diff
Copy
Edit
// draw XY
gl.drawArrays(gl.LINES, offset, this.sheetXY_count);
- offset += this.sheetXY_count;
+ offset += this.sheetXY_count;

// draw XZ
gl.drawArrays(gl.LINES, offset, this.sheetXZ_count);
- offset += this.sheetXZ_count;       // <-- still ok
+ offset += this.sheetXZ_count;

// draw YZ
gl.drawArrays(gl.LINES, offset, this.sheetYZ_count);
(the counts are now correct; the bug was the invisible geometry, not the
offset math, but this keeps them consistent.)

2 Move the vertical sheets away from the camera axis
Put them half a grid unit to the right / forward so they are no longer
edge-on:

Edit
else if (plane === 'XZ') {
-   const ySheet = 0.0;
+   const ySheet = 0.2;              // lift side wall a bit
    … verts.push(x0, ySheet, zPos, x1, ySheet, zPos);
}

else if (plane === 'YZ') {
-   const xSheet = 0.0;
+   const xSheet = 0.2;              // slide end wall a bit
    … verts.push(xSheet, y0, zPos, xSheet, y1, zPos);
}
( 0.2 ≈ 20 % of the clip cube; tweak until it’s clearly visible.)
