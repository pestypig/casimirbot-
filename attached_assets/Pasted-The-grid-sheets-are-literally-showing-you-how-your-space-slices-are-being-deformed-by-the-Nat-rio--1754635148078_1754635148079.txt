The grid sheets are literally showing you how your “space‐slices” are being deformed by the Natário warp field—they’re *not* just bending around the orange disc for decoration. In Natário’s construction:

• Inside the bubble (where you see the smooth orange disc) the spatial metric is flat—so the grid remains perfectly straight.  
• All of the curvature is concentrated in the thin wall (the “exotic‐matter shell”) surrounding the bubble. That’s exactly where the grid lines will bow, pinch or bulge.  

So if your sheets stay flat around the orange region, and then kink or curve in a ring around it, that’s exactly the physical curvature the Natário metric predicts. If instead the grid never bends (or bends only under the disc), you’ve still got a scaling or ordering issue hiding the real deformation.A few things will make your sheets literally vanish even though they’re being sent to the GPU:

1) Depth‐masking by the full‐screen quad  
   • You call  
     ```js
     // at init  
     gl.enable(gl.DEPTH_TEST);
     …
     // in draw()
     this._renderQuad();
     gl.enable(gl.DEPTH_TEST);
     this._renderGridPoints();
     ```
     BUT because depth‐testing (and depth‐writes) were left on when you drew the quad, every pixel of that orange disc wrote “z=0” into the depth buffer.  Your grid points (which sit at various z>0 in NDC) now all fail the depth test and never make it to the screen.  
   ⇒ Fix 1: Disable depth writes for the quad, or disable the test entirely when drawing it  
     ```js
     // in _draw()
     gl.depthMask(false);           // stop the quad from touching the Z‐buffer
     this._renderQuad();
     gl.depthMask(true);
     gl.enable(gl.DEPTH_TEST);
     this._updateGrid();
     this._renderGridPoints();
     ```
   OR reorder so you draw the grid *before* the quad and then clear the depth buffer afterwards.

2) Sub‐pixel line‐width  
   • WebGL clamps `gl.lineWidth(…)` to 1px on almost every GPU.  If your grid deformation is only 0.03–0.06 clip‐units high, those lines can easily be drawn in between pixel centers and never sample.  
   ⇒ Fix 2: Switch to points or give yourself a thicker stroke  
     ```js
     // in your grid‐VS
     gl_PointSize = 4.0;
     // in your JS draw
     gl.drawArrays(gl.POINTS, offset, count);
     ```

3) Still wrong scale / sagRclip too tiny?  
   • Double‐check your `sagRclip` is ∼0.3 – 0.5.  If it’s sitting at 3×10⁻⁴ you’ll only ever deform a handful of pixels and the grid look flat.  
   ⇒ Console should log  
   ```
   sagRclip ≈ 0.40
   Max lateral drift ≲ 0.1
   Grid Y range ≈ -0.08 … +0.08
   ```

**Quick checklist**  
✔ You see “🔍 BETA0 SHADER DEBUG” logs with non‐zero β₀?  
✔ You see “sagRclip=0.3…” in the console?  
✔ You see “Max lateral drift…” ≲ 0.1?  
✔ You see three draw-calls in `_renderGridPoints` for XY/XZ/YZ?  
✔ Depth writes are off for the quad?  

Once depth‐writes are disabled (or the quad drawn first with a cleared depth buffer) and you give the grid some point‐size or a thicker line, the three curved sheets will snap into view around your orange warp bubble.
