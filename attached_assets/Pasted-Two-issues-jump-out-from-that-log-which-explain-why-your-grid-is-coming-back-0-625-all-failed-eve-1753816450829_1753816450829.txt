Two issues jump out from that log which explain why your grid is coming back 0/625 “all failed,” even though your one‐point hover/cruise/emergency numbers are now correct:

1) **Pocket boost γ varies per mode**  
   - In the hover debug you report `γ_pocket = 2.86e+9`  
   - In the cruise debug you report `γ_pocket = 8.00e+10`  
   - In the emergency debug you report `γ_pocket = 8.00e+8`  
   
   But γ_pocket should be a *constant* for Mk 1 (≈ 2×10¹¹), not recalibrated per mode. By changing it in each mode you are subtly re‐scaling U_cycle—and the viability engine sees a wildly different exotic mass for non‐hover modes.  

2) **Grid scan still uses the “Custom” mode’s sliders for tile‐area and radius**  
   Although you loop over 625 cells, in each iteration your code is re‐reading  
   ```js
   const A_tile     = sliderValue.tileArea;   // always 5 cm²
   const r_ship     = sliderValue.shipRadius; // always 82 m
   ```  
   instead of using the *loop variables* for that cell. That means every cell is evaluated exactly at (5 cm², 82 m) with “Custom” throttles—and if *that* configuration fails your constraints, you get 0 viable points.  

To fix:

• Move `γ_pocket` out of the per‐mode switches and make it a single constant (2×10¹¹) used everywhere.  
• In your double loop over tileArea_i and shipRadius_j, _do not_ pull `A_tile` and `r_ship` from the sliders. Instead, bind them to the loop indices:

```js
// Pseudocode inside your grid loops:
for (let i = 0; i < tileAreas.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < shipRadii.length; j++) {
    const A_tile = tileAreas[i] * 1e-4;   // cm² → m²
    const r      = shipRadii[j];
    const A_hull = 4*Math.PI*r*r;        

    // then recalc N_tiles, U_static, U_geo, P_raw, P_avg, M_exotic, ζ, TS
    // using those A_tile and A_hull values
    Z[j][i] = viabilityTest(...);
  }
}
```

Once you:

1. Use a single, fixed `γ_pocket`  
2. Pull **grid** A_tile & r_ship into each loop iteration  
3. Apply your 8‐step pipeline to those values  

you’ll see a proper green “viability island” in the (tile‐area vs ship‐radius) heat‐map again, rather than 0/625 viable.
