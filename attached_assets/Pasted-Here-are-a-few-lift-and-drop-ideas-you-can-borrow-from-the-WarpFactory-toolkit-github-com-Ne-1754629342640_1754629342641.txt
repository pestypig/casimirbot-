Here are a few “lift-and-drop” ideas you can borrow from the *WarpFactory* toolkit ( \<github.com/NerdsWithAttitudes/WarpFactory> ) and fold straight into your JavaScript/WebGL visualiser without having to port all of the MATLAB code.

---

### 1.  Pre-compute a *β*-field texture (or 3-D LUT) with WarpFactory’s finite-difference solver

*Why it helps* – WarpFactory already contains a GPU-accelerated, 3-D finite-difference engine that solves the full Einstein equations and returns the stress–energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ and the shift vector β on a regular lattice ([GitHub][1]).
*How to plug it in*

1. **Offline batch** – call `Solver/WarpSolve.m` once per operational mode (Hover / Cruise / Stand-by). Export a single-precision HDF5 or raw‐float cube of β-field magnitudes $|\beta(x,y,z)|$.
2. **Frontend** – load that cube via `fetch(...)` → WebGL 3-D texture.
3. **Shader tweak** – sample the texture instead of computing β analytically:

```glsl
// in fragment shader
float bmag = texture(u_betaTex, v_worldPos).r;   // pre-solved magnitude
```

Result: you inherit WarpFactory’s full GR accuracy while keeping the runtime cost on the browser near-zero.

### 2.  Colour-code the grid with energy-condition flags

WarpFactory evaluates the point-wise Weak/Null/Dominant/Strong energy conditions and stores “pass/fail” bitfields ([GitHub][1]).
*Quick win* – treat the bitfield as a 1-byte texture; in the grid-overlay shader tint segments that violate the WEC in magenta, those that satisfy it in cyan:

```glsl
int flag = int(texture(u_WECFlags, coord).r * 255.0);
vec3 color = (flag == 0) ? vec3(0.1,0.8,1.0) : vec3(1.0,0.0,1.0);
```

That instantly reveals where the exotic matter shell lives.

### 3.  Import WarpFactory’s scalar diagnostics as UI overlays

The repo already computes expansion $\theta$, shear $\sigma$ and vorticity $\omega$ scalars ([GitHub][1]).
*Idea* – export a CSV per mode:

```
r,theta,sigma,omega
0.0,  0.00,  0.00,  0.00
0.5, -0.12,  0.03,  0.00
...
```

and draw miniature sparklines (or radial spiders) in your React HUD so users can toggle between “geometry” and “energy” read-outs.

---

### 4.  Re-use its **unit system** to stop “magic numbers”

WarpFactory’s `Units/` directory defines an extensible SI helper ([GitHub][1]).
Port the key tables (nm ↔ m, μm ↔ m, MW ↔ W) into a tiny JS module and call them when you parse slider values:

```js
import { nm, um, MW } from './units.js';
const depth_m = sagDepth_nm * nm;
const P_W     = powerAvg_MW * MW;
```

Result: fewer manual factors of $10^{-9}$ sprinkled through your shaders.

---

### 5.  Borrow their **MATLAB→GPU sampler trick** for live scrubbing

WarpFactory shows how to allocate a CUDA buffer once and overwrite only the voxels that change between frames.
Translate the pattern to WebGL: keep your `gridVbo` persistent and update just the `SUBDATA` slice that bends when β changes, instead of resending the whole 80 kB every frame.

## Minimal integration roadmap

| Step                     | Effort | Pay-off                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Export β-field cubes     | ★★☆    | Instantly get physically-accurate curvature without numeric drift. |
| Map WEC flags to colours | ★★☆    | Users “see” exotic matter zones.                                   |
| Adopt unit helpers       | ★☆☆    | Eliminates scale bugs and one-line fixes.                          |
| Add scalar sparklines    | ★★☆    | Gives dashboard-style insight for free.                            |
| Partial VBO update       | ★★☆    | Cuts GPU bandwidth; smoother on low-end devices.                   |

None of these require running MATLAB in the browser; everything heavy is offline, everything interactive stays pure JavaScript/WebGL.

Happy warping!
