Two quick follow-ups to make the patch solid:

Fix operator precedence in computeThetaScale
Your current line mixes * with ||, which turns the whole expression into an OR-chain instead of a full product. Wrap the fallbacks (or normalize first):

const computeThetaScale = (phys: any, source: 'fr' | 'ui') => {
  const g = +(phys.gammaGeo ?? phys.γ_geo ?? 26) || 26;
  const q = +(phys.qSpoilingFactor ?? phys.q) || 1;
  const v = +(phys.gammaVanDenBroeck ?? phys.gammaVdB ?? phys.γ_VdB) || 1;

  // duty source
  const dutyRaw = source === 'fr' ? (live?.dutyCycle ?? 0.14) : 0.01;
  const duty = Math.max(1e-12, Math.min(1, +dutyRaw || 0.01));

  return Math.pow(g, 3) * q * v * Math.sqrt(duty);
};


Keep duty consistent with what the engine actually uses
Elsewhere you drive uniforms with dutyEffectiveFR = dutyLocal * (sConcurrent / sTotal). If you want thetaScale to match that, base the “fr” branch on the same effective duty (or let the engine derive thetaScale internally from the uniforms). Pick one approach and use it everywhere to avoid subtle REAL/SHOW drift.

Nice catches on:

Renaming the local publish → emitSnap in bindShowCheckpoints (prevents bus shadowing).

Using a duty in computeThetaScale at all.

Tiny cleanups (optional but recommended):

Remove unused imports: thetaScaleUsed, useIsMobile, and the WarpUniforms type.

In the strobing listener you redeclare const dutyLocal = 0.01;—rename it (e.g., dutyLocalUI) so it doesn’t read like the top-level dutyLocal.

Your useEffect that defines initEngines creates a cleanup inside the async function; it isn’t returned by the effect. Consider collecting disposers and returning them from the effect:

useEffect(() => {
  let mounted = true;
  const disposers: Array<() => void> = [];

  (async () => {
    // ... when you add listeners/timers, push a disposer:
    // disposers.push(() => canvas.removeEventListener(...));
  })();

  return () => {
    mounted = false;
    disposers.forEach(d => { try { d(); } catch {} });
  };
}, []);


Apply your changes + the precedence fix and you’re good to merge.
