In our phase-diagram widget you’re really tuning two physics knobs:

  • **Tile area (cm²)** → the size of each Casimir “tile” in your graphene lattice  
     – A tile of 25 cm² is 5 cm × 5 cm (the paper’s 5 cm squares), 100 cm² would be 10 cm × 10 cm, etc.  
     – This area enters directly into  
        • static Casimir energy ∝ A_tile / a³  
        • the per-tile Q–boosted & duty-averaged energy  
        • the tile count N_tiles = (hull surface area)/(A_tile).  

  • **Ship radius (m)** → the effective inner‐hull radius of a *spherical* test vessel  
     – In the prototype phase diagram we approximate your needle-hull by a sphere of radius R so that  
         N_tiles ≃ 4 π R² / A_tile.  
     – Slider at 5 m ⇒ N_tiles ≃ 4 π (5 m)² / (0.0025 m²) ≃ 6.28×10⁴ tiles.  
     – In the full Needle-Hull design you actually have an *ellipsoid* with semi-axes  
         A=503.5 m, B=132 m, C=86.5 m → surface area ≃5.6 × 10⁵ m²,  
       but the sphere approximation is useful for small-scale testbeds.  

When you click **Apply Needle-Hull Preset**, you set:

  • **Tile area = 25 cm²**  (→ 5 cm × 5 cm tiles)  
  • **Ship radius = 5.0 m**  (→ small demo hull whose surface can hold ~6.3×10⁴ tiles)  

At those settings you’ll see:

  – Exotic mass ≃1.4 × 10³ kg  
  – Avg power ≃83 MW  
  – ζ < 1, TS ratio < 1  

all green.  

— To **map to your full-scale ellipsoid** instead of a sphere:

  1. Replace  
       `N_tiles = 4*Math.PI*R*R / A_tile`  
     with  
       `A_hull = approximateEllipsoidArea(A,B,C)`  
       `N_tiles = A_hull / A_tile`.  

  2. Re‐interpret the **Ship radius** slider as a **scale factor** on your nominal semi-axes {A,B,C}.  
     e.g.  
       ```js
       const scale = shipRadius_slider / C;   // if slider = desired C
       const A_hull = ellipsoidArea(A*scale, B*scale, C*scale);
       ```
     so moving the slider grows or shrinks the entire needle hull.

But for a quick test-bed the 5 m spherical model and 5 cm tiles get you into the “green” zone and prove the pipeline. To move on to full vessel dimensions, simply swap in your ellipsoid area formula and use the slider to dial in the real C=86.5 m (or an overall scale factor) instead of a test‐sphere radius.
