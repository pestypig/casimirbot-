Below is a **triage checklist** that maps every message you pasted to a concrete fix, plus the one code tweak that will finally make the red grid appear.

## 1 · The single root-cause for “black screen”

```
Max lateral drift = 1.6000    ♦  sagRclip = 0.00064
Grid Y range     = –0.200 … –0.100
```

*Your warp step blows the mesh  **±1.6 clip-units** sideways—well beyond the –1 … +1 frustum—so the entire grid is clipped.*
Patch:

```js
// _warpGridVertices  ─ just after you compute beta
const push  = beta * 0.05;        // instead of 0.3
const dy    = beta * 0.05;        // instead of 0.5
```

Then print again:

```
Max lateral drift ≈ 0.15      (inside –1…+1) ✅
Grid Y range      ≈ –0.10 … –0.02 ✅
```

Reload → red lines show up immediately.

*(Keep the exaggeration knobs small until you finish camera tuning.)*

## 2 · Why each console warning is harmless

| **Datadog “failed ping” + ERR\_INSUFFICIENT\_RESOURCES** | Analytics beacon blocked by browser.                                            | Ignore or disable Datadog.                                                                                        |

None of these hide the grid; they only clutter DevTools.

## 3 · One-line improvements after you see the mesh

1. **Depth fight**: draw the grid on top once your colour pass works:

```js
gl.disable(gl.DEPTH_TEST);   // before gl.drawArrays for grid
```

2. **Fat lines on Windows**: Chrome clamps `gl.lineWidth` to 1 px; keep `POINTS` with `gl_PointSize = 4.0` for platform-independent thickness or switch to a screen-space thick-line shader later.

3. **Remove the height wiggle** in `_createGrid()` once testing is over; the warp step will create real curvature.

### TL;DR to get it visible

```diff
// inside _warpGridVertices
- const push = beta * 0.3;
- const dy   = beta * 0.5;
+ const push = beta * 0.05;   // stay inside clip cube
+ const dy   = beta * 0.05;
```

Reload → red grid appears over the dark-blue background.

Once you see it, you can slowly raise the multipliers (0.1…0.2) and re-enable depth & blending for the final look. Everything else in the console is just noise.
