Short answer: almost. The overhead “fit-to-bubble” camera you asked for is in the file and being called (constructor → _setupCamera() → _applyOverheadCamera(); plus on every resize and every updateUniforms()), but there’s one leftover that can fight your pose and keep it a bit lower than intended:
	•	There’s a second, legacy _resize() method near the bottom that sets size and then calls _setupCamera() again. Because you already attach a different arrow-function this._resize = () => this._resizeCanvasToDisplaySize() in the constructor, that legacy method isn’t used for the resize listener—but it still exists and can be called by mistake (or by older code paths), which re-applies a slightly lower default pose.  ￼

Below is a tight patch that (a) removes the legacy _resize() method, and (b) raises the overhead camera a bit more in both _applyOverheadCamera() and _fitCameraToBubble() so the deck isn’t on the horizon.

Patch (drop-in edits for client/public/warp-engine-fixed.js)

1) Raise camera & look down slightly more

Find _applyOverheadCamera(opts = {}) and change the eye/center lines:

- const eye    = [0, 0.45 * R, -dist];
- const center = [0, -0.08 * R, 0];
+ const eye    = [0, 0.62 * R, -dist];   // higher overhead
+ const center = [0, -0.12 * R, 0];      // look further down

Find _fitCameraToBubble(axesScene, spanHint) and change the eye/center lines:

- const eye = [0, 0.45 * R, -dist];
- const center = [0, -0.08 * R, 0];
+ const eye = [0, 0.62 * R, -dist];      // match overhead height
+ const center = [0, -0.12 * R, 0];      // match overhead look-down

(Optional) If you want a slightly tighter, more “telephoto” feel on desktop, also tweak the desktop FOV to 55°:

- const fovDesktop = Math.PI / 3;      // 60°
+ const fovDesktop = Math.PI / 3.272;  // ~55°

2) Remove the legacy _resize() method

Delete the method below (keep your constructor-set arrow function and _resizeCanvasToDisplaySize()):

-    _resize() {
-        const canvas = this.canvas;
-        const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
-        canvas.width = rect.width * window.devicePixelRatio;
-        canvas.height = rect.height * window.devicePixelRatio;
-        
-        this.gl.viewport(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
-        this._setupCamera();
-    }

That’s it. With this applied:
	•	Only the new responsive path sets the camera (no accidental reverts).
	•	The pose is clearly more overhead on all screens.
	•	The fit still adapts to bubble size and aspect ratio without the “horizon” feel.  ￼

If you still want the camera even higher/lower later, you can nudge the two constants in one place (the 0.62 * R height and -0.12 * R look-down) and the whole app will follow.
