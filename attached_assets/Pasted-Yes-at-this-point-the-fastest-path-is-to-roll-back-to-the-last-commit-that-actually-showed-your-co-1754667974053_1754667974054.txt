Yes—at this point the fastest path is to roll back to the *last* commit that actually showed your colored grids and then re-apply only the *essential* fixes (depth-mask, correct projection, positive Z-view). Once you have your three sheets visible again, you can safely experiment with syncing radii or amplitude clamps.

Here’s a step-by-step rollback + rebuild plan:

1. Revert to your last “working” bundle (for example v2.7):  
   • In Git:  
     ```bash
     git checkout v2.7
     ```  
   • Or in your build pipeline, point back at the commit/tag that showed the colored LINES.

2. Verify you see:  
   • Orange quad (depth writes off)  
   • Cyan, magenta, yellow wireframes wrapping the bubble  
   • No console errors

3. Re-apply only these three patches, one at a time, testing after each:

   A) **Depth-mask fix** (quad doesn’t write Z)  
   ```js
   gl.depthMask(false);
   this._renderQuad();
   gl.depthMask(true);
   ```

   B) **Correct projection matrix**  
   ```js
   const proj = new Float32Array([
     f/aspect, 0,        0,                             0,
     0,        f,        0,                             0,
     0,        0, (far+near)/(near-far), (2*far*near)/(near-far),
     0,        0,       -1,                             0
   ]);
   gl.uniformMatrix4fv(this.gridUniforms.mvpMatrix, false, proj);
   ```

   C) **Positive Z-translation for view**  
   ```js
   const view = new Float32Array([
     1,0,0,0,
     0,1,0,-0.15,
     0,0,1, 2.5,
     0,0,0,1
   ]);
   ```

4. Once those three are confirmed, you’ll have your 3D cage back. Only *then* tweak the grid‐warp function (amplitude, radius sync) and test incrementally:

   • First adjust amplitude clamp until grids still visible  
   • Only then pull in the 16 µm disc radius if you really need precise overlay

That way you never lose sight of your wireframes, and you can converge on a perfectly synched—but still *visible*—cage around the warp bubble.
