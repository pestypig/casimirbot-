You’re *very* close. The inspector is wired to the pipeline + canonical θ, but there’s still one **stale θ reader** inside `WarpRenderInspector.tsx` that ignores standby/vShip and just dumps whatever is in `u_thetaScale`. That’s why your card shows `θ(shader)=1.88e+9` in standby while the panes (which honor mode/parity) look right.

Here’s exactly what to focus on and why:

### 1) `WarpRenderInspector.tsx` — remove the old “Shader vs Canonical” block

* You already have a **mode-aware** ticker that zeroes θ in REAL-standby and only treats “θ(shader)” as the *effective* amplitude after vShip gating (keep this): it reads `U.currentMode`, sets `isREALStandby`, and computes `thetaEffective = isREALStandby ? 0 : thetaCanonical * vShip`.
* But further down there’s a second, older ticker labeled **`// --- Shader vs Canonical ---`** that directly reads `U.thetaScale_actual || U.thetaScale` without any standby/vShip logic (delete this whole block). That’s the source of the non-zero standby readout in the card UI.

**Action:** In `WarpRenderInspector.tsx`, search for `// --- Shader vs Canonical ---` and remove that entire effect. Keep only the “Operational-mode aware θ calculations” effect shown above.

### 2) Pipeline wiring is correct (no changes needed)

* Your pipeline surfaces the values the inspector needs:

  * It exposes **`dutyEffectiveFR`** and a **canonical audit `thetaScaleExpected = γ_geo^3 · q · γ_VdB(vis) · √d_eff`**.
  * Those are also mirrored into the “live” readouts the UI uses (`dutyEffectiveFR`, `gammaVanDenBroeck_vis`, etc.).
* Your renderer adapter **does not push `u_thetaScale`**; it only sends an audit `thetaScaleExpected` and lets the engine compute authoritative θ. (Good — keep it this way.)

### 3) Sanity about “engine is the θ authority”

* The inspector’s *mode-aware* path already prefers `U.thetaScale_actual` (engine telemetry) and multiplies by `vShip`, then forces zero in REAL-standby. That is the correct “shader” definition for the card.

## Quick checklist to get the card readout aligned with the panes

1. **Delete the duplicate ticker**
   Remove the block starting at `// --- Shader vs Canonical ---` in `WarpRenderInspector.tsx`.

2. **Keep the mode-aware ticker**
   The one that computes:

   * `mode = U.currentMode`
   * `isREALStandby = parity && mode === 'standby'`
   * `thetaCanonical = U.thetaScale_actual ?? U.thetaScale`
   * `thetaEffective = isREALStandby ? 0 : thetaCanonical * vShip`
     (This is already in the file.)

3. **No changes needed in pipeline/adapter**
   They already provide `dutyEffectiveFR` + `thetaScaleExpected` and avoid setting engine θ directly.

## Smoke test (fast)

* Switch to **standby**; confirm the card now shows **`θ(shader)=0` in REAL** while SHOW can be non-zero only if you’ve given it vShip>0.
* Flip to **hover/cruise**; the card “θ(shader)” should match pane brightness trends (it’s `θ_canonical × vShip`).
* If anything still reads non-zero in REAL-standby, log `engine.uniforms.currentMode`, `engine.uniforms.physicsParityMode`, `engine.uniforms.vShip`, and `engine.uniforms.thetaScale_actual` in the inspector effect you kept to verify the engine is getting `currentMode:'standby'`.

That one deletion should make the inspector card agree with the WarpBubble panes on standby again, while keeping the pipeline audit intact.
