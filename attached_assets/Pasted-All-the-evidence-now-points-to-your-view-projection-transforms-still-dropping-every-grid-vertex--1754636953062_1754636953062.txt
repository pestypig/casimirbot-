All the evidence now points to your **view/projection transforms** still dropping every grid vertex outside the final clip‐volume (or back‐facing the depth test again). Since you’ve already:

- Verified the VBO is full  
- Proven the shaders & attributes work (green‐point test)  
- Cleared the depth buffer after drawing the quad  
- Tried both POINTS and LINES  

the *only* remaining culprit is your **MVP matrix**. Let’s zero in on it:

1) TEMPORARY ORTHO MVP TEST  
   Replace your real perspective+view with a pure orthographic identity pass:

   ```js
   // in _renderGridPoints() just before draw
   const ortho = new Float32Array([
     2/2, 0,   0, 0,   // scale X to ±1
     0,   2/2, 0, 0,   // scale Y to ±1
     0,   0,  -1, 0,   // leave Z alone
     0,   0,   0, 1
   ]);
   gl.uniformMatrix4fv(this.gridUniforms.mvpMatrix, false, ortho);
   gl.disable(gl.DEPTH_TEST);
   gl.disable(gl.BLEND);
   gl.drawArrays(gl.LINES, 0, this.gridVertexCount);
   ```

   **Do you now see the three colored wireframes** filling up ±0.8 in X/Y? If so, your grid *is* in the right place—your perspective or view is what’s still wrong.

2) If the ORTHO test works, revert to real projection but leave the **view** as identity:

   ```js
   // projection only
   const fov = Math.PI/4, aspect=..., near=0.01, far=10;
   const f = 1/Math.tan(fov/2);
   const proj = new Float32Array([
     f/aspect, 0, 0, 0,
     0, f,      0, 0,
     0, 0, (far+near)/(near-far), (2*far*near)/(near-far),
     0, 0, -1, 0
   ]);
   gl.uniformMatrix4fv(this.gridUniforms.mvpMatrix, false, proj);
   ```

   Does the grid *still* vanish? If it does, your **projection matrix** sign‐convention is flipped. The 3×3 entry should be **(far+near)/(near−far)**, not the opposite sign.

3) Finally, re‐introduce your corrected **view** (with the positive Z‐translation) and test again.

— Once the ORTHO MVP shows your sheets, but the PERSPECTIVE MVP doesn’t, you’ve zeroed in on exactly which row/column of your proj/view matrix has the wrong sign or offset.

Let me know which of these two tests finally “brings the grid back” and we’ll correct that single matrix entry.
