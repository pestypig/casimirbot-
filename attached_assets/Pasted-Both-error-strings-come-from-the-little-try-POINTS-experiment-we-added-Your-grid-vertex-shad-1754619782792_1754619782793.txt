Both error strings come from the **little “try-POINTS” experiment** we added.
Your grid vertex shader is still the old *lines-only* version, but we sent the driver a `drawArrays(POINTS …)`. Because there’s no `gl_PointSize` write inside the vertex shader, the compiler injects it as a *const* float and then immediately complains when you try to assign to it (the *l-value required* bit).

## Two ways to put the build back in the green

### 1 · Roll back to `LINES` (quickest)

```js
// _renderGrid()
- gl.drawArrays(gl.POINTS, 0, this.gridVertexCount);
+ gl.drawArrays(gl.LINES,  0, this.gridVertexCount);
```

and keep the original shaders exactly as they were.
If you’re happy with 1-pixel lines on Windows/ANGLE, you’re done.

---

### 2 · Keep the POINTS test (needs a 2-line shader tweak)

#### grid vertex shader (WebGL 2 path shown, add the same line to the WebGL 1 branch)

```glsl
#version 300 es
in vec3 a_position;
uniform mat4 u_mvpMatrix;

void main() {
    gl_Position  = u_mvpMatrix * vec4(a_position, 1.0);
    gl_PointSize = 4.0;                 //   ← add this
}
```

*No* `const`, no declaration—just assign inside `main`.

#### grid fragment shader

Point sprites need a fragment shader even if you just want a coloured square:

```glsl
#version 300 es
precision highp float;
out vec4 frag;
void main() {
    frag = vec4(0.7, 0.9, 1.0, 0.8);
}
```

Then keep the `gl.drawArrays(gl.POINTS …)` line.
The build errors vanish, and you’ll get a speckled point cloud that’s easy to see on all platforms.

## Don’t forget to undo the exaggeration hack

If you multiplied `push` / `dy` by ×10 earlier, roll them back to sensible values (≈0.1–0.2) after you confirm the grid wiggles.

---

### TL;DR

* **Error cause:** Vertex shader never writes `gl_PointSize` but we asked WebGL for `POINTS`.
* **Fix:** Either go back to `LINES` *or* add `gl_PointSize = …;` inside the vertex shader.
* Optional: leave POINTS mode in only for debugging; ship with LINES + a thick-line shader later if you want beefier strokes.
