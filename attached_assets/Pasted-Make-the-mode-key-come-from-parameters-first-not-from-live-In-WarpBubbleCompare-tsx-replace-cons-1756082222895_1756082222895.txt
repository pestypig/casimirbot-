Make the mode key come from parameters first, not from live:
In WarpBubbleCompare.tsx replace:

const currentModeKey = ((live?.currentMode as ModeKey) || "hover") as ModeKey;


with:

const currentModeKey =
  ((parameters?.currentMode as ModeKey) ??
   (live?.currentMode as ModeKey) ??
   "hover") as ModeKey;


Don’t let the live-tick effect push physics amplitude (or anything that can change θ)
In the “7.3 — Push uniforms when live values change” effect, strip θ (and anything that back-doors amplitude) before pushing:

const realU = toRealUniforms(snapForMode);
const showU = toShowUniforms(snapForMode);

// kill amplitude from live ticks
delete (realU as any).thetaScale;
delete (showU as any).thetaScale;
// (optional, if you’ve ever computed these in shaders)
// delete (realU as any).gammaVdB;
// delete (showU as any).gammaVdB;

// Keep vShip consistent with the *current* parameters mode, not stale live
const isStandby = String(parameters?.currentMode || '').toLowerCase() === 'standby';
realU.vShip = 0;                 // REAL never “flies”
showU.vShip = isStandby ? 0 : 1; // SHOW only “flies” when not standby

// Now only push cosmetics/visibility + sector mux from the live tick
pushSafe(leftEngine, {
  exposure: realU.exposure,
  zeroStop: realU.zeroStop,
  colorMode: realU.colorMode,
  ridgeMode: realU.ridgeMode
});

pushSafe(rightEngine, {
  exposure: showU.exposure,
  zeroStop: showU.zeroStop,
  curvatureGainT: showU.curvatureGainT,
  curvatureBoostMax: showU.curvatureBoostMax,
  userGain: showU.userGain,
  vizGain: showU.vizGain,
  displayGain: showU.displayGain,
  colorMode: showU.colorMode,
  ridgeMode: showU.ridgeMode,
  vShip: showU.vShip
});


(The parameters-driven effect remains the single source for thetaScale, sectors/duty, γ’s, etc.)

Make the checkpoint “expected θ” choose its source consistently
When computing “expected” in the checkpoint panel, prefer parameters semantics for that pane (REAL = FR duty; SHOW = UI duty/sector avg; standby = 0). Even if you keep using live for the display, this eliminates the “100% off” that appears when the pane is on the new mode but live is still on the old one for ~1s.
