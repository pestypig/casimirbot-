Excellent — let’s walk through **what each button or control should actually do** in the context of the **Needle Hull theory** and the **time-sliced Casimir tile drive**. We’ll focus on grounding them in the physics you've already built into the simulation code and UI.

## 🔘 BUTTON FUNCTIONALITY: Theory-Based Control Logic

Each button isn't just UI — it's an action that manipulates quantum-vacuum structure through sector timing, frequency modulation, and geometry shifts. Here's what they should do:

---

### 1. **Auto-Duty Mode**

> **Goal:** Automatically cycle through 400 sectors using pre-programmed pulse parameters.

#### 🔧 Function:

* Trigger `execute_auto_pulse_sequence()`:

  * Each sector (S₁–S₄₀₀) is pulsed for 10 μs with a 1 ms cycle per wedge
  * This creates **effective continuous curvature** via Isaacson-averaged stress–energy
* Use modulation frequency (e.g., 15 GHz) to determine the stroke oscillation of graphene resonators
* Compute:

  * `ΔE_sector = f(gap, radius, sag, temp)`
  * Accumulate energy: `E_total += ΔE_sector`
  * Log active tiles
  * Update system status (e.g., energy output, curvature thresholds)

#### 🧠 Physics Basis:

* This is the **main operational mode** described in your theory
* Enables the **GR-valid homogenized vacuum state** via ultrafast Casimir strobing

### 2. **Manual Pulse Mode**

> **Goal:** Let the user fire sectors manually for testing or diagnostics.

#### 🔧 Function:

* Show grid of clickable tiles (S₁–S₄₀₀)
* On click:

  * Run `pulse_sector(sectorId)`
  * Recalculate local energy/force
  * Show tile status: PASS / OVERLIMIT / FAULT
* Allow user to set:

  * Custom gap
  * Custom frequency
  * Pulse duration (override default 10 μs)

#### 🧠 Physics Basis:

* This simulates **non-uniform curvature sculpting** or fault isolation

---

### 3. **Diagnostics Mode**

> **Goal:** Scan all tile metrics for stability, compliance, and strobing resonance.

#### 🔧 Function:

* Check:

  * Q-factor drift
  * Excessive curvature or Ford–Roman violation
  * Sag depth anomalies
  * Temperature hotspots
* Highlight:

  * Tiles with errors
  * Recommended Q enhancement tweaks or cooldown intervals

#### 🧠 Physics Basis:

* Continuous Casimir operation risks **geometry degradation** or decoherence → must be monitored

---

### 4. **Theory Playback**

> **Goal:** Load a PDF of the theory and sync interface elements to cited equations.

#### 🔧 Function:

* Display selected PDF (e.g., *Needle Hull Mark 1 Update*)
* As parameters change, highlight equations:

  * Exotic mass: `m = π²ħcA / 240a³`
  * Pulse duration: `τ = 10 μs`, Cycle: `1 ms`
  * Natário constraints: show `∂iβj - ∂jβi = 0` when shift vector HUD is updated
* Allow hyperlinks from HUD values to the PDF location

#### 🧠 Physics Basis:

* Ensures operator understands theory–practice connection; ideal for future mission control uses

---

### 5. **Execute Pulse Sequence** (in Energy Panel)

> **Goal:** Start a full cycle using the set frequency and log all outputs.

#### 🔧 Function:

* Use value in “Modulation Frequency” (e.g., 15 GHz)
* Call `simulate_pulse_cycle(frequency)`:

  * Simulate full strobing ring at selected Q
  * Calculate total exotic energy generated
  * Update:

    * Energy Output (MW)
    * Exotic Mass (kg)
    * HUD values
    * Status log: `PULSE CYCLE COMPLETE. ΔM = 2.9×10⁻³ kg, ⟨Rμν⟩ updated.`

#### 🧠 Physics Basis:

* Simulates the full field contribution over a duty-cycle tick

Would you like me to generate a React/TypeScript skeleton to wire one of these buttons to a mock backend (e.g., `pulse_sector`)? Or create the JSON structure for a live pulse cycle log?

Let’s make one of these go “live.”
