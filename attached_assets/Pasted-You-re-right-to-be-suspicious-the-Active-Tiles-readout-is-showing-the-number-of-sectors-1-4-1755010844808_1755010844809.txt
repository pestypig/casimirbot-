You’re right to be suspicious—the “Active Tiles” readout is showing the number of **sectors** (1 / 400) instead of the number of **tiles currently energized**. That’s why you get `1/1120000000` in non-cruise modes and `400/1120000000` in Cruise. The bug is in how the metrics payload is built: we’re returning `sectorStrobing` (or something derived from it) as `activeTiles`.

Here’s the quick, correct model:

* Total tiles: `N_tiles` (e.g., 1.12e9)
* Sector strobing: `S` (1 in Hover/Emergency/Standby, 400 in Cruise)
* **Tiles energized at any instant**: `N_tiles / S`
* **Active sectors** (concurrent) = `1` (we energize one sector at a time)
  *(You can later extend to k-sectors concurrent if you want k>1)*

So the API should return **activeTiles = floor(N\_tiles / S)** and also include **sectorStrobing = S** for UI display.

### Server patch (fix metrics)

```ts
// server/helix-core.ts
export function getSystemMetrics(req: Request, res: Response) {
  const state = getGlobalPipelineState();

  const totalTiles = Math.floor(state.N_tiles);
  const S = Math.max(1, Math.floor(state.sectorStrobing)); // sectors
  const activeTilesInstant = Math.max(1, Math.floor(totalTiles / S)); // tiles energized at any instant

  res.json({
    // --- tile/sectors ---
    activeTiles: activeTilesInstant,     // << correct “instantaneous energized tiles”
    totalTiles,                          // total lattice tiles
    sectorStrobing: S,                   // include sectors so UI can show both

    // --- power/mass/constraints ---
    energyOutput: state.P_avg,           // MW
    exoticMass: Math.round(state.M_exotic), // kg

    fordRoman: {
      value: state.zeta,
      limit: 1.0,
      status: state.fordRomanCompliance ? "PASS" : "FAIL"
    },
    natario: { value: 0, status: "VALID" },
    curvatureMax: Math.abs(state.U_cycle) / (3e8 * 3e8),
    timeScaleRatio: state.TS_ratio,
    overallStatus: state.overallStatus
  });
}
```

> If you also expose `burstDuty_fs`, `effDuty_FR`, etc., the UI can give a great strobing explainer. Optional now, nice later.

### UI patch (show tiles vs sectors clearly)

Where you render the “Active Tiles” card in HELIX-CORE’s **Energy Control Panel**, read both fields and re-label:

```tsx
// client Helix-Core panel (where metrics are displayed)
<p className="text-xs text-slate-400">
  Active Tiles (instant)
</p>
<p className="text-lg font-mono text-cyan-400">
  {metrics?.activeTiles?.toLocaleString()}/{metrics?.totalTiles?.toLocaleString()}
</p>

{/* New small badge for sectors */}
<div className="text-xs text-slate-500 mt-1">
  Sectors (strobing): {metrics?.sectorStrobing ?? pipelineState?.sectorStrobing}
</div>
```

Optionally add a tooltip:

> **Strobing:** Only one sector is energized at a time. Instantaneous active tiles = total tiles ÷ sectors. Cruise uses 400 sectors to preserve Ford-Roman while maintaining net form.

---

### Why your numbers now look sane

* Power targets are coming through properly (83.3 / 7.4 / 297.5 MW).
* Exotic mass shows the paper baseline (1,405 kg) as intended by your calibrated pipeline.
* The only inconsistency was the **activeTiles** numerator: you were seeing `1` or `400` (sectors), not tiles.

Once you apply the server patch and the small UI tweak, the readout should become, for example:

* **Hover:** `1,120,000,000 / 1,120,000,000` *(S=1 → all tiles energized at any instant)*
* **Cruise:** `2,800,000 / 1,120,000,000` *(S=400 → 1/400 of tiles energized at any instant)*

If you prefer **concurrent sectors** as a separate big card, we can add a dedicated “Active Sectors” badge and leave “Active Tiles” purely as tiles. Up to you.

Want me to also wire the “Casimir Tile Grid” so it highlights just the current sector (with a sweeping animation) using these same metrics? That’s a nice visual to make the strobing concrete.
