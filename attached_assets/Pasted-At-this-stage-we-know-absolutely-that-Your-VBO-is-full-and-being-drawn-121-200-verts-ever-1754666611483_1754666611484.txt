At this stage we know **absolutely** that:

- Your VBO is full and being drawn (121 200 verts every frame).  
- Your shaders compile, bind and draw under every MVP/test (green points, white dots).  
- Your projection and view matrices are now correct.  
- You’ve disabled depth writes on the quad so nothing should occlude the grid.

Yet in the “real” pass you see *no* colored grid.  That can only mean the grid *is* being drawn, but the **fragment output** is effectively black or fully transparent—i.e. you’re writing to color but can’t see it.

Here’s the fastest way to prove it:

1) **Hard‐wire the grid FS to bright red**  
   In your grid fragment shader (`gridFs`), temporarily replace its body with:
   ```glsl
   // top of fragment shader
   precision highp float;
   out vec4 frag;      // for WebGL2; or use gl_FragColor for WebGL1
   void main() {
     frag = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);  // FORCE solid RED
   }
   ```
   Recompile and reload.  If you now see red wireframes wrapping the bubble, then you know the problem is not your draw order or depth—but that your “real” `u_sheetColor` / `u_energyFlag` uniforms are wrong (likely being set to zero, or you have a stale uniform location).

2) **Check your uniform locations**  
   Right after you link `this.gridProgram`, add:
   ```js
   console.log("sheetColor loc =", this.gridUniforms.sheetColor);   // should be ≥0
   console.log("energyFlag loc =", this.gridUniforms.energyFlag);   // should be ≥0
   ```
   If either is `null`/`-1`, you’re never actually writing your colors into the shader.

3) **Restore the real FS and re‐set the uniforms**  
   Once you see red geometry, switch back to your multi‐color logic but explicitly bind:
   ```js
   gl.uniform1f(this.gridUniforms.energyFlag, 0.0);
   gl.uniform3f(this.gridUniforms.sheetColor, 0.1, 0.8, 1.0);  // cyan floor
   gl.drawArrays(gl.LINES, 0, this.sheetXY_count);
   // etc… magenta and yellow.
   ```
   If you still don’t see cyan/magenta/yellow, the culprit was your uniforms never arriving in the shader.

— In short: **force a known solid color** in the shader to confirm the grid *is* being shaded, then re‐diagnose your uniform updates (locations, calls). Once the red grid shows up, the colored sheets will appear immediately.
