Must-fix blockers

Put "use client" at the top of each file
Your first file (WarpRenderInspector) uses React hooks and window, but doesn’t start with the directive. In Next.js this will throw.
Action: Add "use client"; as the very first line in both files (and make sure it’s the first statement).

Remove duplicate top-level function names in WarpRenderInspector
You redeclare several identifiers later in the same module. That’s a hard compile error (“Identifier has already been declared”). The early “placeholder” versions need to go.
Remove these early definitions near the top of the file:

normalizeKeys(obj: any)

toUniforms(data: any)

bindShowCheckpoints(engine, canvas) (placeholder)

thetaGainExpected(bound: any)

reportThetaConsistency(bound: any, …)

(Keep the later, fuller implementations you added further down.)

SHOW panel never actually mounts Grid3DEngine
showRendererType defaults to 'grid3d', but the JSX for SHOW always renders a <canvas>. You also have a grid3dRef bridge effect that never runs because nothing assigns the ref.
Action: Render Grid3DEngine for SHOW when showRendererType === 'grid3d' and pass ref={grid3dRef}.

- <canvas ref={rightRef} className="w-full h-full block touch-manipulation select-none"/>
+ {showRendererType === 'grid3d' ? (
+   <Grid3DEngine
+     ref={grid3dRef}
+     uniforms={showUniforms}
+     className="w-full h-full block"
+     style={{ background: 'black' }}
+   />
+ ) : (
+   <canvas ref={rightRef} className="w-full h-full block touch-manipulation select-none"/>
+ )}


Two default exports if these are in one file
If you pasted both into a single module you’ll get “Multiple default exports” and lots of duplicate identifiers.
Action: Keep them as two separate files, e.g.:

WarpRenderInspector.tsx (starts with "use client";)

WarpBubbleCompare.tsx (already has "use client"; — leave it at the top)

If you ever pass realRenderer="grid3d"
Your REAL panel already supports <Grid3DEngine …/>, but you never bridge it back to leftEngine.current. Many effects assume leftEngine.current exists.
Action (only if you plan to use grid3d for REAL): add a grid3dRefLeft and a small bridge effect mirroring the SHOW bridge so leftEngine.current and leftRef.current are wired to the wrapper’s engine/canvas.
