Short answer: yes — your latest files show the camera/fit patches in place.
	•	In WarpVisualizer.tsx you now bootstrap the engine with the full uniform set before the first draw and only then mark it loaded. That’s the right way to eliminate the initial “jump.”  ￼
	•	In warp-engine-fixed.js the engine now (a) calls _fitCameraToBubble(...) immediately from _setupCamera(), (b) caps DPR on phones, and (c) uses the new, higher view in _adjustCameraForSpan. All three are present.  ￼

If you still see a tiny correction after load and want a touch more overhead, here’s a very small, safe tweak you can apply:

Patch 1 — raise the camera a bit and aim a hair lower

In client/public/warp-engine-fixed.js

-    const eye = [0, 0.35, -desired];
-    const center = [0, -0.05, 0];
+    const eye = [0, 0.50, -desired];   // a little higher
+    const center = [0, -0.10, 0];      // look slightly further down

(inside _adjustCameraForSpan(span))

Patch 2 — make “fit” even earlier on mobile & reduce any last resize snap

Still in warp-engine-fixed.js, keep the DPR cap but give the fitter a tiny extra margin on small screens so it lands perfectly on first frame:

-const GRID_DEFAULTS = {
-  spanPadding: 1.35,
+const GRID_DEFAULTS = {
+  spanPadding: (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(max-width: 768px)').matches)
+    ? 1.45   // a touch more padding on phones so the first fit is perfect
+    : 1.35,
  minSpan: 2.6,
  divisions: 100
};

(Optional) Patch 3 — nudge the initial look the same way

This keeps the very first look (before any uniforms arrive) consistent with the raised view:

-    const axes = this.uniforms?.axesScene || this._lastAxesScene || [0.45, 0.25, 0.25];
-    const span = this._gridSpan || 1;
-    // Use the responsive fitter immediately
-    this._fitCameraToBubble(axes, span);
+    const axes = this.uniforms?.axesScene || this._lastAxesScene || [0.45, 0.25, 0.25];
+    const span = this._gridSpan || 1;
+    // Use the responsive fitter immediately
+    this._fitCameraToBubble(axes, span);
+    // …and gently bias the view a bit higher until uniforms arrive
+    this._adjustCameraForSpan(span);

Why this helps
	•	Raising eye.y and lowering center.y produces a clearer overhead view without changing the bubble scale.
	•	Slightly larger spanPadding on phones gives the fitter more breathing room so you don’t see a tiny “re-fit” when the hull axes arrive.
	•	You’ve already solved the main “snap” by bootstrapping with axesScene/gridSpan from React before first draw; these tweaks just polish the experience.

If you want me to ship these changes as a single consolidated diff for your repo paths, I can do that too.
