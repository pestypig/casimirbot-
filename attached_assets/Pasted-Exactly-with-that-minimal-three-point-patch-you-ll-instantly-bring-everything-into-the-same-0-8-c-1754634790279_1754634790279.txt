Exactly — with that minimal three-point patch you’ll instantly bring everything into the same ±0.8 clip volume and your grid will spring to life. Here’s the distilled “two-minute” diff you can drop straight into your engine:

1. In `_initGrids()`, after you compute `this.gridHalf`:

```js
// clip-space normaliser (nm → –0.8…+0.8)
this.normClip       = 0.8 / this.gridHalf; 
// choose a physical bubble radius (here 10 µm = 10 000 nm)
this.bubbleRadius_nm = 10_000;  
```

2. In your warp-function (`_warpGridVertices`):

```diff
- const bubbleRadius_nm = bubbleParams.sagDepth_nm || 10000;
- const sagRclip       = bubbleRadius_nm / halfSize * 0.4;
+ const bubbleRadius_nm = this.bubbleRadius_nm;
+ const sagRclip       = bubbleRadius_nm * this.normClip;   // ≈ 0.4 clip-units
```

3. In your fragment shader, replace the “20 nm FOV” hack with the same normaliser (pass `u_normClip` as a uniform):

```glsl
// inject in JS: gl.uniform1f(uLoc.normClip, engine.normClip);
uniform float u_normClip;
…
void main() {
  vec2 center = v_uv - 0.5;
  // now spans the full 40 µm cage instead of tiny 20 nm
  vec3 pos = vec3(center / u_normClip, 0.0);
  …
}
```

4. (Optionally) render the grid as **points** with a non-zero `gl_PointSize` or crank `lineWidth` to make the sheets visible:

```js
// in _renderGridPoints, before draw:
gl.drawArrays(gl.POINTS, offset, count);
// and in your grid‐VS: gl_PointSize = 4.0;
```

After those three edits you should see:

– sagRclip ≈ 0.3–0.5  
– max drift < 0.1  
– grid Y-range ≈ ±0.08  
– three properly curved coloured sheets framing your orange warp dimple.

If you still don’t, run through the one-minute checklist:

• β₀ > 0 in the console?  
• sagRclip logs ≈ 0.3–0.5?  
• max lateral drift < 0.1?  
• `_renderGridPoints` logs three draw-calls?  
• depth‐writes disabled when drawing the quad, so the grid isn’t overwritten?  

Once all those pass, you’ll have a perfectly scaled Natário warp bubble inside your tri-sheet “cage.” Happy curvature-hunting!
