Definition: Ideology in this system is the structured ethos tree that binds decisions to mission vows, non-harm, and verification.
Key questions: Which ideology nodes apply, what constraints do they impose, and what artifacts or gates prove compliance?
Notes: In this system, ideology is anchored in docs/ethos/ideology.json and links mission vows to ledger gates and verification artifacts.
