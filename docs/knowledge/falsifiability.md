Definition: Falsifiability is the idea that a claim is scientific only if there is a possible observation or test that could show it to be false.
Key questions: What evidence would contradict the claim, and can we design a test that exposes that contradiction?
Notes: It separates testable claims from purely interpretive or unfalsifiable statements.
