- Definition: Morphospace attractors are stable regions in a conceptual morphology space where trajectories tend to converge.
- Guidance: Treat this as a general concept unless the question points to a specific repo file or panel.
- Fallback: If no repo anchor is supplied, answer in general terms and avoid speculative system mapping.
