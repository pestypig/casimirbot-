- Definition: The red giant phase is a late stellar evolution stage marked by envelope expansion and core changes.
- Anchors: client/src/pages/start.tsx and client/src/pages/star-hydrostatic-panel.tsx carry the repo-facing star narratives.
- Evidence: docs/curvature-unit-solar-notes.md links solar language to the star math context.
