Definition: Verification is the process of checking that a system meets specified requirements or constraints, often through tests, proofs, or audits.
Key questions: What requirement is being checked, what evidence is sufficient, and how is success measured?
Notes: Verification differs from validation, which asks whether the system meets user needs.
