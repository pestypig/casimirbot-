Definition: The scientific method is a structured way to investigate a question by proposing a hypothesis, testing it against observations or experiments, and updating conclusions based on the results.
Key questions: What is the claim, what evidence would support or refute it, and how do we evaluate the results?
Notes: The emphasis is on falsifiable tests and repeatable checks.
