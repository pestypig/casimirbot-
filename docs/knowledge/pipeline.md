Definition: A pipeline is an ordered sequence of stages where the output of one stage becomes the input to the next, often with checkpoints or gates between stages.
Key questions: What are the stages, what data passes between them, and where are the verification or quality gates?
Notes: Pipelines emphasize repeatability and explicit handoffs between steps.
