Definition: In this repo, a warp bubble is a modeled spacetime region defined by a shift vector field and expansion constraints.
Key questions: Which bubble model is used and where are its constraints checked?
Notes: See modules/warp/warp-module.ts and modules/warp/natario-warp.ts for the implementation.
