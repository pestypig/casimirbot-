- Definition: Analysis loops are the prototype analyzers (noise, diffusion, belief graph) exposed through the analysis-loops API.
- Anchors: server/routes/analysis-loops.ts defines the endpoints and request schemas for running the loops.
- Evidence: modules/analysis/README.md and modules/analysis/belief-graph-loop.ts document the loop behaviors and outputs.
