- Definition: The potato threshold is the Pi ~ 1 transition where bodies move from irregular shapes to round, tracked with E_potato = kappa_drive / kappa_body.
- Anchors: client/src/pages/potato-threshold-lab.tsx and client/src/pages/star-hydrostatic-panel.tsx surface Pi and E_potato in the UI.
- Evidence: client/src/physics/curvature.ts and warp-web/km-scale-warp-ledger.html contain the proxy math used to compute the ratio.
