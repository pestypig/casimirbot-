Definition: Platonic reasoning treats abstract ideals or forms as the reference point for evaluating real-world instances, using the ideal as a guide for interpretation.
Key questions: What is the ideal model, how do real instances approximate it, and where do they deviate?
Notes: In this system, "platonic reasoning" maps to the concept registry plus the platonic gates that enforce definition lint, evidence eligibility, and stability before narration (server/services/helix-ask/concepts.ts, server/services/helix-ask/platonic-gates.ts, server/services/helix-ask/intent-directory.ts, server/routes/agi.plan.ts).
