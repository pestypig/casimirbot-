Definition: The Stewardship Ledger is the ideology rule that capability must be constrained by auditable repayment, safety margins, and provenance.
Key questions: Which ledger variables are being monitored, which constraints apply, and where are violations surfaced?
Notes: In this repo, the ledger vocabulary connects ideology anchors (docs/ethos/ideology.json, docs/ethos/why.md) to curvature proxies (shared/curvature-proxy.ts), proof pack derivations (server/helix-proof-pack.ts), and operator UI panels like Drive Guards (client/src/components/DriveGuardsPanel.tsx).
