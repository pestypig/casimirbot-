Definition: Not-knowing, bearing witness, taking action: a governance cycle that learns in public and corrects course with evidence.
Key questions: What are we not sure about? How are we bearing witness with grounded signals? What action will be measured and corrected?
Notes: Tags: loop, practice, governance, learning, accountability. Societal effect: creates a repeatable governance rhythm and prevents action-before-evidence. Children: civic-signal-loop.
