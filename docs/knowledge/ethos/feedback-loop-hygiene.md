Definition: Close loops only with verified signals; in governance that means publish indicators, verify sources, and keep rollback paths before action.
Key questions: Which signals are verified? What indicators are public? What rollback path exists when signals drift?
Notes: Tags: feedback, innovation, guardrails. Societal effect: reduces rumor-driven escalation, improves accountability, and preserves trust. Children: habit-pressure-break.
