Definition: The warp ledger is the km-scale constraint narrative that exposes falsifiable scalings, guard bands, and curvature bookkeeping in a form operators can audit.
Key questions: Where the ledger is rendered, which endpoints serve it, and which math definitions anchor its scalings?
Notes: The microsite is warp-web/km-scale-warp-ledger.html, the panel wrapper is client/src/components/WarpLedgerPanel.tsx, the server route is in server/routes.ts (/km-scale-warp-ledger), and the math anchors include shared/curvature-proxy.ts plus the proof-pack pipeline in server/helix-proof-pack.ts, with cross-links documented in docs/casimir-tile-mechanism.md and docs/curvature-unit-solar-notes.md.
