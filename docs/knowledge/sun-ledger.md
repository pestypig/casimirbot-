Definition: The Sun ledger is the mission-ethos promise that every extracted joule must be matched by measurable replenishment and non-harm.
Key questions: What is being taken, how is repayment measured, and which gates prove the ledger stays within bounds?
Notes: Anchor this phrase to docs/ethos/ideology.json and docs/ethos/why.md, then map it to ledger math like kappa_drive vs kappa_body in shared/curvature-proxy.ts and proof pack outputs in server/helix-proof-pack.ts.
