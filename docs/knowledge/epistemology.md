Definition: Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that studies knowledge, justification, and the difference between true knowledge and mere belief.
Key questions: What counts as knowledge, how is belief justified, and which sources of belief are reliable?
Notes: It often contrasts empirical, rational, and pragmatic standards for justification.
