Definition: The ADM 3+1 split decomposes spacetime into lapse, shift, and spatial metric to evolve or check constraints.
Key questions: How are lapse and shift represented, and where are the constraints enforced?
Notes: See server/gr/evolution/solver.ts and server/gr/evolution/initial-data.ts for 3+1 handling.
