Definition: The Casimir effect is the energy difference between bounded and unbounded field modes, expressed as a force or energy density for a given geometry.
Key questions: Which geometry is assumed and where is the energy density computed?
Notes: Core computations live in modules/sim_core/static-casimir.ts and modules/dynamic/dynamic-casimir.ts.
