Definition: Casimir magnitude depends on geometry because the allowed mode spectrum changes with boundary shape and separation.
Key questions: Which geometry is modeled, and what approximations are used to compute its energy density?
Notes: Geometry-specific assumptions are encoded near the static Casimir routines.
