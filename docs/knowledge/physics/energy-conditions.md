Definition: Energy conditions (NEC, WEC, SEC, DEC) are inequalities that restrict stress-energy tensors to physically reasonable regimes.
Key questions: Which conditions are checked and how do they map to repo constraint gates?
Notes: Constraint policies live in server/gr/gr-constraint-policy.ts and server/gr/gr-evaluation.ts.
