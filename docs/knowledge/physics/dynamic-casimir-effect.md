Definition: The dynamic Casimir effect models energy production from time-varying boundaries and treats the Casimir energy as time dependent.
Key questions: Which boundary parameters vary in time, and how is the modulation modeled?
Notes: See modules/dynamic/dynamic-casimir.ts for the time-dependent pipeline model.
