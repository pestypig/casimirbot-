Definition: Dimensional analysis checks that equations balance units, preventing invalid substitutions or scaling errors.
Key questions: Which inputs are dimensionless, and where do unit conversions occur?
Notes: Apply unit checks at SI boundaries and in any pipeline step that mixes measured quantities.
