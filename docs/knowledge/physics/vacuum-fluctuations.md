Definition: Vacuum fluctuations are the baseline field modes present even without excitations; the Casimir effect models shifts in these modes under boundaries.
Key questions: Which boundaries or geometries are assumed, and how do they alter the mode spectrum?
Notes: See modules/sim_core/static-casimir.ts for how the baseline energy density is computed.
