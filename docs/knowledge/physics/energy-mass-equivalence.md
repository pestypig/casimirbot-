Definition: Energy-mass equivalence links energy and mass through E=mc^2, letting the system compare power or energy requirements to mass budgets.
Key questions: Which quantities are energy-like versus mass-like, and how are they compared?
Notes: Use this relationship when interpreting ledger values and power or mass ladders.
