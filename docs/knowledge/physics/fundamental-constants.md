Definition: Fundamental constants such as c, G, hbar, and kB define the conversion factors between unit systems and set physical scales.
Key questions: Which constants are assumed, and where are they encoded in the repo?
Notes: modules/core/physics-constants.ts is the canonical anchor for constant values.
