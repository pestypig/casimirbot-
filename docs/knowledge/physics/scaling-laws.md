Definition: Scaling laws describe how outputs change with parameters, focusing on order-of-magnitude trends rather than exact values.
Key questions: Which parameters dominate a result, and what happens if they are scaled up or down?
Notes: Use scaling to interpret guard bands and to spot unrealistic parameter combinations early.
