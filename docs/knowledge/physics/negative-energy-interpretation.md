Definition: Negative energy densities are tightly constrained by quantum inequalities and are not treated as freely available energy.
Key questions: Which bounds apply, and how are compliance checks represented in the pipeline?
Notes: This repo treats negative energy as a bounded input and reports guardrail compliance explicitly.
