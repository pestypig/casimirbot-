Definition: The Ford-Roman quantum inequality bounds how much negative energy can persist over a sampling time, limiting exotic configurations.
Key questions: What sampling time is assumed and how is the bound enforced?
Notes: The constraint policy and WARP_AGENTS.md capture the repo's QI guardrails.
