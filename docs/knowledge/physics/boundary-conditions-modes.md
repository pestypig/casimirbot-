Definition: Boundary conditions restrict the allowed field modes, which changes the energy spectrum and drives Casimir forces.
Key questions: What boundary assumptions are used, and which geometry is being modeled?
Notes: Geometry-specific assumptions live alongside the static Casimir calculations.
