- Definition: Casimir tiles are the sectorized lattice elements tracked in the tile grid and telemetry views.
- Anchors: client/src/components/CasimirTileGridPanel.tsx renders the grid, while docs/casimir-tile-mechanism.md explains the tile mechanism.
- Evidence: docs/knowledge/warp/casimir-lattice.md and server/helix-core.ts connect the tile ledger to core telemetry.
