| paper_id | equation_id | assumptions (chart/observer/normalization/units) | runtime_signal | mapping_type | derivation_notes | falsifier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alcubierre1994 https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0009013 | Eq. (1) | Chart: coordinates adapted to t=const foliation. Observer: Eulerian normal (n^a) defined by lapse/shift. Normalization: g(n,n) = -1. Units: G = c = 1. | `alpha`, `beta^i`, `gamma_ij` (ADM fields consumed by GR solver / constraint gate) | exact | Eq. (1) is the ADM line element defining how (alpha, beta, gamma) appear in ds^2. No Needle Hull implementation claim. | Reconstruct g_{mu nu} from runtime (alpha,beta,gamma). If it does not reproduce Eq. (1) in the declared chart, ADM extraction is wrong. |
| Alcubierre1994 https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0009013 | Eq. (9) | Same chart/observer/units as Eq. (1); D_i is the covariant derivative compatible with gamma_ij. | `K_ij` (extrinsic curvature for constraints) | exact | Eq. (9) defines K_ij in terms of (alpha,beta,gamma, d_t gamma). | On a test metric with known d_t gamma_ij, if runtime K_ij differs from Eq. (9) beyond tolerance, it is not equation-faithful. |
| Gourgoulhon2007 https://people-lux.obspm.fr/gourgoulhon/pdf/form3p1.pdf | Eq. (10.5) | Chart: 3+1 foliation (Sigma_t). Observer: Eulerian n. Normalization: g(n,n) = -1. Units: geometric with explicit 8pi factors. | `H_residual` (Hamiltonian constraint gate) | derived | Eq. (10.5) defines Hamiltonian-constraint violation H in terms of (3)R, K, K_ij K^ij, and E = T(n,n). Geometry-derived only if computed from ADM and matter projections. | Minkowski data (gamma_ij = delta_ij, K_ij = 0, E = 0) must yield H = 0. If H_residual != 0, mapping fails. |
| Gourgoulhon2007 https://people-lux.obspm.fr/gourgoulhon/pdf/form3p1.pdf | Eq. (10.7) | Same foliation/observer; D_i gamma-compatible; p_i matter momentum density projection. | `M_residual` (momentum constraint gate) | derived | Eq. (10.7) defines momentum-constraint violation M_i from D_j K^j_i - D_i K - 8pi p_i. | Vacuum data with K_ij = 0 and p_i = 0 must yield M_i = 0. If M_residual != 0, mapping fails. |
| Natario2002 gr-qc/0110086 (mirror: https://www.ecn.org/cunfi/0110086.pdf) | Def. 1.1 | Chart: M = R^4 with standard (t,x^i). Observer: n_a = -dt, n^a = partial_t + X. Fields: X^i bounded smooth. | `beta` (Natario shift beta in Needle Hull geometry section) | derived | Natario defines the metric via X in Def. 1.1. Mapping beta to X is an identification step within the metric, not a repo claim. | If runtime beta cannot be associated to any X such that ds^2 matches Def. 1.1, Natario-compatibility fails. |
| Natario2002 gr-qc/0110086 (mirror: https://www.ecn.org/cunfi/0110086.pdf) | Cor. 1.5 | Same chart; expansion defined as theta = div X. | `ThetaAudit` (runtime theta guardrail) | proxy_only | Natario expansion requires spatial derivatives (div X). If ThetaAudit is not computed from div of a spatial field (or -Tr K in a declared convention), there is no geometry-derived chain. | Compute div X (or D_i beta^i) from runtime beta field. If it does not match ThetaAudit (up to sign/units), ThetaAudit is not the expansion scalar. |
| Natario2002 gr-qc/0110086 (mirror: https://www.ecn.org/cunfi/0110086.pdf) | Thm. 1.7 (identity) | Eulerian observer; uses (3)R, trK, K_ij K^ij; flat-slice special case sets (3)R = 0. | `T00_avg` / `rho_E` (pipeline stress-energy signal used by QI + GR gates) | proxy_only | Natario rho is derived forward from geometry; if runtime sets T00 from an energy pipeline instead, mapping is proxy-only. | Compute rho from runtime (alpha,beta,gamma) via Thm. 1.7. If it disagrees with T00_avg or rho_E, mapping fails. |
| VanDenBroeck1999 gr-qc/9905084 (mirror: http://www.ufologie.net/htm/warpdrive.pdf) | Eq. (4) | Units: c = G = hbar = 1. Constant v assumed. Conformal factor B(r_s). | `gammaVdB` (seed-pocket amplification) | proxy_only | VdB modification is functional: ds^2 = -dt^2 + B^2(r_s)[(dx - v f dt)^2 + dy^2 + dz^2]. No single gammaVdB scalar in Eq. (4). | Implement B(r) and compare observables sensitive to B' and B''. If scalar-only model cannot reproduce them, proxy fails. |
| VanDenBroeck1999 gr-qc/9905084 (mirror: http://www.ufologie.net/htm/warpdrive.pdf) | Eq. (11) | Region II transition; orthonormal basis Eq. (10); T^{hat0hat0} depends on B', B'', (1/r) B'. | `VdB_band` / region-II energy density | proxy_only | A band/clamp depending only on a scalar cannot encode Eq. (11) derivative structure. | Vary B'(r), B''(r) with scalar factor fixed. If runtime energy density does not respond, it is not Eq. (11)-faithful. |
| VanDenBroeck1999 gr-qc/9905084 (mirror: http://www.ufologie.net/htm/warpdrive.pdf) | Eq. (17) | QI-derived thickness scaling; depends on v_s and Planck length L_P. | `wallThickness` | proxy_only | Needle Hull uses macroscopic wall thicknesses; no explicit runtime equation ties them to Eq. (17) in the provided material. | Insert runtime wall thickness into Eq. (17). If bound is violated, "VdB thickness satisfied" is falsified. |
| FordRoman1994 https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9410043 | Eq. (64) | Lorentzian-smeared energy density in flat 4D; inertial timelike observer. | `zeta` / `FordRomanQI` guardrail | proxy_only | Eq. (64) gives hat{rho} >= -3/(32 pi^2 t0^4). Without explicit runtime computation of hat{rho}, zeta is proxy-only. | Compute hat{rho} from runtime T_{mu nu} u^mu u^nu and compare derived zeta to runtime zeta. |
| FordRoman1994 https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9410043 | Eq. (65) | Lorentzian sampling kernel with width t0; defines hat{rho} by time average. | `sampling_time` / `tau_window` inputs to `FordRomanQI` | proxy_only | Eq. (65) defines the averaging integral. If runtime sampling time does not enter via this kernel, mapping is proxy-only. | Change sampling_time by factor s. If margin does not scale in the t0^-4 direction implied by Eq. (64), mapping fails. |
| Wilson2011 (DCE) https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.4714 | NO_SOURCE | Experimental superconducting circuit; not GR geometry. | `modulationFreq_GHz` | proxy_only | Needle Hull cites 11 GHz DCE observation and argues scaling to ~15 GHz is feasible; no ADM chain. | If runtime modulation frequency differs from cited GHz regime, citation-to-knob mapping fails. |
| Krasnok2024 https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0155213 | NO_SOURCE | SRF cavity survey; not GR geometry. | `qCavity` / `Q` | proxy_only | Needle Hull uses Q ~ 1e9 as a multiplicative pump; no ADM chain. | If runtime assumes Q far outside cited range, mapping fails. |

| Padamsee2004 https://cds.cern.ch/record/808364/files/p233.pdf | NO_SOURCE | Accelerator SRF engineering; not GR geometry. | `cryoLoadModel` / `cavityDissipation` | proxy_only | SRF dissipation figures used for cryogenic load plausibility; no ADM chain. | If runtime cryo model implies dissipation far above cited SRF regimes, mapping fails. |
| Nugent2022 https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20220009350/downloads/MAN_8.3_Nugent_06-16-22.pdf | NO_SOURCE | NASA technical report; not GR geometry. | `COP_20K` | proxy_only | COP benchmark; no ADM chain. | If runtime COP assumptions exceed report bounds, mapping fails. |
| CornwellWelch2011 https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3594197 | NO_SOURCE | Materials strength; not GR geometry. | `maxHoopStress` / `structuralMargin` | proxy_only | Hoop-stress margining; no ADM chain. | If runtime stress exceeds cited material bounds, mapping fails. |
| LiYang2023 https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202314558 | NO_SOURCE | Materials survey; not GR geometry. | `maxHoopStress` / `structuralMargin` | proxy_only | Projected diamond strength margining; no ADM chain. | If runtime stress exceeds cited material bounds, mapping fails. |
| Momota1991 https://www.nifs.ac.jp/report/NIFS-101.pdf | NO_SOURCE | Fusion confinement report; not GR geometry. | `FRC_pod` / `powerPodModel` | proxy_only | FRC roadmap support; no ADM chain. | If runtime assumes pod performance beyond report bounds, mapping fails. |
| HelionEnergy2021 https://www.eetimes.com/helion-energy-achieves-key-fusion-milestone | NO_SOURCE (NON_PRIMARY) | Non-primary source; excluded under primary-only rule. | `powerPodModel` | proxy_only | Not admissible for equation-trace claims under primary-only rule. | Replace with primary source; until then, mapping is non-primary. |
