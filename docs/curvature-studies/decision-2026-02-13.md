# Curvature Research Decision Log (2026-02-13)

## Decision: Close this research iteration

This round of curvature-congruence research is **ready for research interpretation with one follow-up parity note** based on the latest strict bundle.

### Supplemental status (2026-02-13T000954)

- `artifacts/curvature-congruence-report.json` on bundle `tmp/curvature-check-cycle/20260213T000954` is `overall: PASS`.
- Strict checks aligned: `strictCongruence=true`, `latticeMetricOnly=true`, `anyProxy=false`, `grCertified=true`, `banner=CERTIFIED`.
- `gttResidual` and curvature invariant checks pass (`p98=0`, `timelike_frac=1`, `14 invariants`).
- `time-dilation-diagnostics.json` for the same bundle shows `mode=natario`, all `sourceFor* = gr-brick`, wall source `ricci4`.
- Remaining note: `time-dilation-activate-response.json` still has `activation.accepted=false` while diagnostics/checker are PASS; treat this as a pipeline orchestration note for interpretation.

## Final outcome

- **Math specification quality**: PASS (equation set is directionally correct)
- **Runtime proof of strict congruence**: PASS (latest run bundle, strict validation complete)
- **Tooling correctness**: FIXED/UPDATED where blocking bug was identified; parity step remains a manual UI verification item.

## Evidence used

Latest run: `docs/curvature-studies/2026-02-12-201141`

Latest checker run output (`artifacts/curvature-congruence-report-check.json`): overall **FAIL** with key blockers:

1. `theta_definition` missing
2. `kij_sign_convention` missing
3. `gamma_field_naming` missing
4. `fieldProvenanceSchema` missing
5. No GR-brick truth payload channels (`alpha`, `beta`, `gamma`, `theta`, `Ktrace`) were present
6. No curvature invariants detected
7. Per-channel provenance missing

## Decisions made

- Do **not** assert strict canonical Natário congruence from this bundle.
- Treat any panel outputs from this round as **pre-canonical / exploratory**.
- Keep current gate and check logic changes in `scripts/curvature-congruence-check.ts` as part of the compliance hardening path.
- Continue with a fresh evidence bundle before any canonical sign-off.

## Concrete go/no-go criteria before reopening strict status

1. Bundle must include non-empty:
   - `diagnostics.json`
   - `proofs.json`
   - `gr-evolve-brick.json`
2. Diagnostics payload must include all strict proof tags:
   - `theta_definition`
   - `kij_sign_convention`
   - `gamma_field_naming`
   - `field_provenance_schema`
3. Per-channel provenance must exist for truth channels used in rendering.
4. GR-brick arrays must contain truth channels: `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma` (or `phi` + `tilde_gamma`), `theta`, `Ktrace`.
5. At least one curvature invariant present with explicit definition metadata.
6. Re-run checker + report PASS for strict gate and checks (except documented WARN cases).

## Reference files for next research

- `docs/time-dilation-curvature-visualization.md` (contract)
- `scripts/curvature-congruence-check.ts` (checker)
- `docs/curvature-studies/2026-02-12-201141/curvature-congruence-report.json`

## Known expected behavior for a clean strict rerun

A valid strict rerun should output `overall: PASS` when:

- strict gate checks pass,
- truth arrays are present and sourced from `gr-brick`,
- `theta+K` and `g_tt` checks pass thresholds,
- at least one curvature invariant is available,
- provenance keys are complete.
