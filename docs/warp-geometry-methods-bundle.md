# Warp Geometry Methods Bundle

Status: draft  
Owner: dan  
Scope: M0–M5 artifacts, task plan, and synthesis cross-links

## Purpose
Provide a single index that links all methods-layer artifacts, the task plan, and the synthesis doc. This serves as the canonical navigation entry for execution and review.

## Core References
- Task plan: `docs/warp-tree-dag-task.md`
- Synthesis: `docs/warp-geometry-congruence-synthesis.md`
- State of the art: `docs/warp-geometry-congruence-state-of-the-art.md`

## Methods Artifacts (M0–M5)
- M0 CL0 methods: `docs/warp-geometry-cl0-methods.md`
- M1 chart contract: `docs/warp-geometry-cl1-cl2-chart-contract.md`
- M2 constraint-first path: `docs/warp-geometry-cl3-constraint-first-path.md`
- M3 guardrail map: `docs/warp-geometry-cl4-guardrail-map.md`
- M4 VdB region II method: `docs/warp-geometry-vdb-region-ii-method.md`
- M5 sigma-to-Delta policy: `docs/warp-geometry-sigma-delta-policy.md`

## Usage
1. Start with the task plan for phase order and acceptance criteria.
2. Use the synthesis doc to understand assumptions, open questions, and CL gaps.
3. Use the M0–M5 artifacts to execute and log each closure method.
