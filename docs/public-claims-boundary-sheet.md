# Public Claims Boundary Sheet (Readiness Upgrade)

**Scope:** public decks/briefs and stakeholder summaries.

## Allowed claims
- Reduced-order diagnostics can be discussed as **research readiness**, not propulsion readiness.
- QI/QEI and Natário congruence checks can be cited as safety/governance guardrails.
- Evidence tiers must be stated explicitly: diagnostic, reduced-order, certified-as-governance-only.

## Prohibited claims
- No claim of physically viable warp propulsion.
- No loophole framing for pulsing or strobing schedules.
- No claim that proxy-derived values are geometry-derived.
- No certified-tier language unless strict contracts + applicability are satisfied.

## Required disclaimer text (must appear in public assets)
"This material reports diagnostic/reduced-order readiness signals and governance guardrails. It does not claim warp propulsion feasibility or near-term deployment."
