# 90-Day Action Plan to Upgrade Readiness

Maturity posture: **diagnostic -> reduced-order -> certified-as-governance-only**.

1. Unify threshold canon in runtime + policy docs.
2. Harden Natário congruence contracts in strict mode (observer/chart/normalization/units required).
3. Maintain analytic regression fixtures for Alcubierre + Natário sign conventions.
4. Use QI applicability gate (`NOT_APPLICABLE`) when curvature-window assumptions fail.
5. Label repayment semantics as `repayment_heuristic` unless theorem-mapped.
6. Enforce public claim boundaries via doc + CI disclaimer checks.
7. Ship deterministic evidence packs with commit/checksum/claim-tier snapshot.
8. Add audience mode so public outputs avoid speculative/internal proxy language.
9. Standardize pre-brief reviewer rubric with issue mapping.
10. Keep lunar logistics and warp research framing explicitly separated.
11. After full-solve reaches `REDUCED_ORDER_ADMISSIBLE`, rederive all QI-facing UI panels (`DriveGuardsPanel`, `WarpProofPanel`/`FrontProofsLedger`, `WarpExperimentLadderPanel`) from one canonical QI contract (`marginRatioRaw`, `marginRatio`, `applicabilityStatus`, `reasonCode[]`, provenance fields), with a parity test that fails on drift.
