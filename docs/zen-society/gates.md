# Zen Society Standard Gates

These gates are required for each pillar template and its artifacts.

## Two-key approval (legal + ethos)
- Legal key: validate against the jurisdictional ruleset and authorized
  signatory registry.
- Ethos key: validate against the ideology nodeRefs and minimum checks.
- Record approvals in the decision log and link evidence in the artifacts.

## Verification and feedback loops
- Use `verification-checklist` for recurring audits and public indicators.
- Use `feedback-loop-hygiene` for correction triggers, escalation, and closure.
- Publish indicator updates and change logs on the defined cadence.

## Required references
- `docs/ethos/ideology.json` for nodeRefs.
- `docs/zen-society/ethos-crosswalk.json` for required checks.
- `docs/zen-society/templates/signatory-registry.md` for signatory provenance.
- `docs/zen-society/templates/decision-log.md` for decision continuity.
