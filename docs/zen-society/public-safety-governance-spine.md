# Public Safety Governance Spine (Zen-aligned)

Purpose
- Provide a lawful, nonviolent governance spine that bridges civic institutions and enforcement without predation or interference.

Boundary
- This framework supports lawful rights education, oversight design, and nonviolent response only. It does not include evasion, interference, or tactical guidance.

Principle
- Informing is compassion: when rules are opaque, fear and rumor become de facto policy. Clear guidance and correction logs reduce suffering by keeping people anchored to reality.

## Shared facts + transparency
NodeRefs: right-speech-infrastructure, voice-integrity, data-dignity, civic-memory-continuity
Intent: Prevent rumor governance by publishing clear rules, definitions, and corrections; keep records legible over time; minimize data collection.
Minimal artifact: Public Policy Ledger (definitions, policies, updates, correction log, rationale archive).
Public indicators:
- policy update cadence
- correction lag
- data retention compliance
- redaction audit pass rate

## Jurisdictional clarity + dual-key gating
NodeRefs: jurisdictional-floor, two-key-approval, provenance-protocol, external-interface-integrity, impermanence-by-design, koan-governance
Intent: Make inter-agency cooperation legible and bounded; require legal and ethos review for joint actions; log decisions with review triggers.
Minimal artifact: Inter-Agency Cooperation Charter (authority scope, limits, required review, dispute path, sunset schedule).
Public indicators:
- percent joint actions with logged authority basis
- review completion rate
- expired-but-active exceptions = 0

## Safe reporting + non-retaliation
NodeRefs: right-speech-infrastructure, compromised-channel-response, no-bypass-guardrail, data-dignity
Intent: Provide lawful, safe channels for complaints and harm reports with independent follow-up and retaliation safeguards.
Minimal artifact: Trusted Reporting Protocol (anonymity options, follow-up SLAs, anti-retaliation triggers, appeals path).
Public indicators:
- follow-up SLA rate
- retaliation incident rate
- closure-with-independent-confirmation rate

## Non-harm enforcement standards
NodeRefs: integrity-protocols, no-bypass-guardrail, restorative-harm-repair
Intent: Make de-escalation and proportionality the default; mandate independent investigations when force is used; provide repair pathways when harm occurs.
Minimal artifact: Use-of-Force Accountability Standard + Harm Repair Ladder.
Public indicators:
- force incident rate
- independent review completion rate
- time-to-remedy
- repeat-incident rate

## Community liaison + mediation
NodeRefs: sangha-architecture, skillful-mediation, interbeing-systems
Intent: Prevent community fracture by building durable liaison containers and mediated dispute pathways; treat public safety as a system with dependencies (trust, reporting, service access).
Minimal artifact: Community Liaison Charter + Mediation Ladder.
Public indicators:
- community trust surveys
- participation rates
- dispute resolution rate
- escalation-by-force rate

## Oversight + anti-capture
NodeRefs: capture-resistance, integrity-protocols, koan-governance
Intent: Make capture difficult: independent audits, rotation of sensitive roles, conflict disclosures, and public accountability metrics. Keep tradeoffs explicit.
Minimal artifact: Capture Risk Register + Tradeoff Ledger + Audit Plan.
Public indicators:
- concentration index
- audit exception rate
- COI disclosure compliance
- reversal-trigger execution rate

## Missing bridges worth adding

### Due process access and counsel capacity
NodeRefs: integrity-protocols, voice-integrity, restorative-harm-repair, data-dignity
Intent: Rights without access are ceremonial. Ensure lawful access to counsel and language support.
Minimal artifact: Access-to-Counsel Pathway (referrals, language access, timelines, documentation standards).
Public indicators:
- time-to-counsel
- language access availability
- outcomes by access level (aggregated, privacy-safe)

### Training + certification as a safety gate
NodeRefs: bodhisattva-craft, integrity-protocols, verification-checklist
Intent: Good doctrine dies without practice. Training and renewal are safety gates, not formalities.
Minimal artifact: Certification Register (who is trained, when renewed, what standards).
Public indicators:
- training completion and renewal rate
- complaint rate by training status
- incident rate trend

Pack-ready note
