Prompt Version: `v1`  
Prompt SHA256: `34A2550BBCEA5F1A25B508D73D8D47075305161DBA667384998304DD84699BF2`

Claim tier posture: `diagnostic` / `reduced-order` (no propulsion certification claim)

## Imported executive verdict snapshot

The imported research output states this presentation posture:

- Government / civil space stakeholders: `GO (limited)` as governance-first research stack.
- Defense / mission operators: `NO-GO` for mission capability framing.
- Industry / investors: `GO (conditional)` as methods/software governance stack.
- Academic collaborators: `GO` for open technical collaboration under explicit limits.

## Imported framing snapshot

The imported report emphasizes:

1. Separate mathematical representability from physical plausibility and experimental actionability.
2. Keep warp claims long-horizon and non-propulsion in current stakeholder materials.
3. Treat QI/QEIs and quantum-interest-style repayment as hard constraint drivers, not loopholes.
4. Require strict separation between metric-derived paths and proxy fallback behavior.
5. Keep `FordRomanQI`, `ThetaAudit`, `TS_ratio_min`, `VdB_band`, and GR constraint gates visible in external proof narratives.

## Imported risk posture snapshot

- Defensible now: governance/auditability, deterministic first-fail semantics, strict-mode provenance blocking.
- Conditional: reduced-order QI/TS/metric mapping claims (assumption-sensitive).
- Not defensible now: physical warp viability, scalable negative-energy sourcing, near/mid-term FTL capability claims.

## Intended use

This artifact is tracked as the first report run for the frozen prompt and should be used as the comparison baseline for subsequent runs with identical prompt hash.
