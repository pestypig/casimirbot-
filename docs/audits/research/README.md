# ToE Research Artifacts

This folder stores research artifacts for tickets with:

- `research_gate.risk_class = physics_unknown`
- `research_gate.risk_class = tier_promotion`

## Naming

Use ticket-prefixed filenames:

- `TOE-<id>-physics-research-brief.md`
- `TOE-<id>-safety-envelope-analysis.md`
- `TOE-<id>-tier-promotion-rationale.md`
- `TOE-<id>-comparative-evidence-pack.md`

## Minimum Content

Each research artifact should include:

1. Claim being evaluated.
2. Assumptions and bounds.
3. Falsifiable acceptance criteria.
4. Source mapping:
   - source -> code path -> test path -> gate.
5. Tier recommendation:
   - `diagnostic|reduced-order|certified`.
