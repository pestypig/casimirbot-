# Warp Full-Solve Campaign Execution Report (2026-02-24)

## Executive verdict
**INADMISSIBLE**

## Required companion
- Executive translation: `docs/audits/research/warp-gates-executive-translation-2026-02-24.md`

## Lane provenance
- Artifact lane: **readiness**
- Budget-stress lane can legitimately emit timeout-driven NOT_READY outcomes due to strict runtime budgets.
- Readiness lane (`--ci-fast-path`) is the source of gate evaluability and canonical campaign artifacts.

## Gate scoreboard (G0..G8)
- PASS: 7
- FAIL: 1
- UNKNOWN: 0
- NOT_READY: 0
- NOT_APPLICABLE: 1
- Total gates: 9
- Reconciled: true

## NOT_READY cause classes
- timeout_budget: 0
- missing_required_signals: 0
- policy_not_applicable_misuse: 0
- other: 0

## Decision output
- Final decision label: **INADMISSIBLE**
- Claim posture: diagnostic/reduced-order (fail-closed on hard evidence gaps).

## Boundary statement
This campaign defines falsifiable reduced-order full-solve gates and reproducible evidence requirements; it is not a physical warp feasibility claim.
