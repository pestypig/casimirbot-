# Warp G4 DEGA autoloop next step

## Hard boundary statement
This campaign defines falsifiable reduced-order full-solve gates and reproducible evidence requirements; it is not a physical warp feasibility claim.

## Current deterministic state
- class: margin_limited
- solved: false
- canonical decision: INADMISSIBLE
- canonical first fail: UNKNOWN
- canonical class: margin_limited
- parity class: applicability_limited
- parity freshness: fresh

## Stop criteria
- maxIterations: 10
- maxWallClockMinutes: 30
- stallCycles: 3

## Ideology context
- ideology root: mission-ethos
- ideology title: Mission Ethos
- ideology advisory branches: bodhisattva-craft, beginners-mind, struggle-testament, devotion-course, worldview-integrity
Ideology context is advisory only and cannot override evidence gates, guardrails, or completion criteria.
