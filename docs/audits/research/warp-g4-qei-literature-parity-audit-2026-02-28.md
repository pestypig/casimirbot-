# Literature-to-Implementation Parity Audit for QI/QEI Measurement and Representation Semantics

“This campaign defines falsifiable reduced-order full-solve gates and reproducible evidence requirements; it is not a physical warp feasibility claim.”

### A) Executive parity verdict (max 10 bullets)

- **The repo’s core gate shape \(\propto -K/\tau^{4}\) matches the dimensional scaling of the canonical 4D timelike worldline quantum inequality for a massless field under time-smearing** (i.e., “shorter sampling time \(\Rightarrow\) more stringent bound”). citeturn35search35turn2search2 **[Canonical-authoritative]**
- **The literature’s required left-hand-side object is a *smeared, renormalized expectation value* of the stress-energy density operator along an observer worldline**, \(\int d\tau\, g(\tau)\langle T_{\mu\nu}u^\mu u^\nu\rangle_{\text{ren}}\), while the codebase uses multiple *representation channels* (model-derived Casimir density; curvature-derived proxy density; “effective” \(T_{00}\)), creating a high-risk operator/semantic mismatch unless explicitly segregated in evidence. citeturn35search35turn24search2 **[Canonical-authoritative]**
- **The repo’s “curvature applicability / short-sampling” notion is directionally aligned with the standard argument: flat-space QI can only be imported locally when the sampling scale is small compared to curvature and boundary scales**. citeturn2search2turn24search6 **[Canonical-authoritative]**
- **However: the implementation’s specific curvature proxying of “\(T_{00}\)” from geometric scalars is assumption-heavy relative to semiclassical/QFT usage, because QIs constrain \(\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle_{\text{ren}}\), not a metric-inverted classical stress tensor nor a scalar curvature surrogate**. citeturn24search2turn3search6 **[Canonical-authoritative]**
- **Null vs timelike comparability must be explicit**: QI/QEI bounds strongly differ by averaging direction; in 4D Minkowski there is no general null worldline QI bound (weighted averages along null geodesics are unbounded below), so any repo construct that implicitly treats null-like sampling as equivalent is inconsistent with core results. citeturn3search0turn24search7 **[Canonical-authoritative]**
- **Theoretical “constant” parity is weak/inconclusive without a field-content declaration** (massless scalar vs EM vs massive, coupling, dimensions, sampling kernel): \(K\) is not universal across field types and sampling functions; therefore a single fixed \(K\) used as a universal gate is an assumption unless parameterized and source-locked. citeturn35search35turn24search0turn24search6 **[Inconclusive]**
- **Renormalization-scheme ambiguity is not optional in curved spacetime**: \(\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle_{\text{ren}}\) admits additive local conserved curvature terms; importing a flat-space QI into curved settings without tracking this ambiguity makes “\(T_{00}\)” semantics fragile near threshold. citeturn3search1turn3search6turn24search2 **[Canonical-authoritative]**
- **Decision robustness near threshold is currently under-justified if uncertainty is not propagated through (measurement → representation → smear → compare)**; literature results are exact inequalities under assumptions, but the code’s *inputs* are inferred quantities with epistemic + aleatory uncertainty. citeturn24search6turn24search5turn24search2 **[Canonical-authoritative]**
- **Overall parity verdict:** the repo’s *mathematical skeleton* (time-smearing, \(\tau^{-4}\) scaling, curvature-scale gating idea) is plausible, but parity is **inconsistent/assumption-heavy** at the “what is \(T_{00}\)?” layer and **inconclusive** at the “what is \(K\)?” layer unless the code explicitly binds those to primary sources and uncertainty accounting. citeturn2search2turn24search6turn24search2 **[Canonical-authoritative]**

### C) Measurement-to-representation taxonomy

This section is the “audit spine” for *measured → represented → inferred* with explicit mapping functions, mandatory assumptions, and failure modes. “Representation target” is 무엇이 gate에 들어가는가를 의미합니다: the scalar compared to a QI/QEI bound.

| Mechanism / channel | What is **measured** | What is **represented** | What is **inferred** | Mapping function (minimal form) | Assumptions required | Known failure modes / aliasing risks |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Timelike QI/QEI (canonical worldline) | None directly (in theory); operationally one measures detector response/energy flow proxies | \(\rho(\tau) := \langle T_{\mu\nu}u^\mu u^\nu\rangle_{\rm ren}\) along a **timelike** worldline | Smeared energy density \(\bar\rho_g := \int d\tau\, g(\tau)\rho(\tau)\) | \(\bar\rho_g \ge -C[g]/\tau^4\), where \(C[g]\) depends on sampling kernel and field content; for Lorentzian kernel Ford–Roman give \(-3/(32\pi^2\tau_0^4)\) in 4D Minkowski massless scalar case citeturn35search35turn2search3 | (i) Quantity is renormalized expectation value; (ii) worldline is timelike inertial (or conditions for extension); (iii) sampling function matches the constant used; (iv) field type/coupling declared | (a) **Operator mismatch**: using classical/GR \(T_{00}\) or curvature proxy; (b) **kernel mismatch**: Gaussian vs Lorentzian constants; (c) **state-class mismatch** (Hadamard etc.); (d) discretization/window truncation |
| Curved-spacetime “short sampling time” import of flat QI | Curvature invariants / geometry model (often simulated, not physically measured) | Applicability flag (whether flat-space QI is legitimate locally) | Whether to apply \(-K/\tau^4\) or require curved correction terms | Enforce \(\tau \ll \ell_{\rm curv}\) and \(\tau \ll \ell_{\rm boundary}\); in static curved cases QI reduces to flat form with subdominant curvature corrections in short-sampling limit citeturn2search2turn24search6 | (i) Geometry is smooth, static as required; (ii) curvature scale extraction is correct for the bound used; (iii) bound is being applied to the right observer class | (a) Using a *scalar* curvature proxy may miss relevant tensor components; (b) boundary scale may dominate but be unmeasured; (c) “not applicable” must not be interpreted as “pass” |
| Null-contracted averaging (NEC-like sampling) | None directly (theory); sometimes used as proxy for focusing/energy conditions | \(\langle T_{ab}k^ak^b\rangle_{\rm ren}\) along **null geodesic** | Candidate null-smeared scalar \(\int d\lambda\, f(\lambda)\langle T_{ab}k^ak^b\rangle\) | In 4D Minkowski, such weighted null averages can be unbounded below (no null QI), so no universal \(-K/\tau^4\) gate exists for null averaging citeturn3search0turn24search7 | Must distinguish timelike vs null sampling by construction | **Critical alias risk**: if repo uses large boost factors / near-null sampling and still applies timelike QI constants, decisions can be systematically wrong |
| “Quantum interest” pulse accounting | Time-resolved energy density proxy (from subsystem model or telemetry-derived energy density estimate) | Negative-energy pulse + compensating positive pulse bookkeeping | Whether energy debt is “repaid” within allowed separation-amplitude relation | Requires decomposition \(\rho(t)=\rho_{-}(t)+\rho_{+}(t)\) and a “separation” measure; Ford–Roman frame the constraint as temporal compensation tied to QI’s citeturn3search3 | Pulse decomposition must be well-posed and match sampling kernel; otherwise “interest” is artifact | Aliasing of oscillatory signals into spurious pulses; window-cutting artifacts; ambiguity in defining “separation” under different \(g(t)\) |
| Curvature-to-stress “proxy \(T_{00}\)” via Einstein equation scaling | Geometry scalars (e.g., Kretschmann \(R_{abcd}R^{abcd}\), Ricci invariants) | A scalar “energy density proxy” \(\rho_{\rm proxy}\) or “\(T_{00}\)” scalar | Decision scalar used in QI inequality against \(-K/\tau^4\) | Heuristic mapping \(\rho_{\rm proxy}\sim \frac{c^4}{8\pi G}\,\kappa\) for some curvature scalar proxy \(\kappa\) (dimensionally \(\kappa\sim 1/L^2\) or similar), then treat as \(T_{00}\) input | Assumes classical Einstein equation applies pointwise to the represented scalar channel; ignores renormalization ambiguities and operator nature of \(T_{\mu\nu}\) citeturn24search2turn3search6 | (a) **Semantic mismatch**: QI constrains \(\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle_{\rm ren}\), not curvature-inverted scalar; (b) curvature scalar can be dominated by components unrelated to the sampled observer contraction; (c) double-counting if curvature already includes quantum corrections via effective action |

### D) QI/QEI comparability table (repo-facing)

This is the parity crosswalk from *repo constructs* to *literature analogs*, with equivalence conditions and confidence.

| Repo construct (as implemented in `pestypig/casimirbot-`) | Literature analog | Required conditions for equivalence | Unit/sampling normalization requirements | Confidence | Verdict |

### E) Uncertainty and decision robustness

This section formalizes how measurement/inference uncertainty can flip a gate decision near threshold 1. It is phrased generically so it can be applied to whichever precise margin variable your code uses.

**Canonical target decision variable.** A Ford–Roman-type gate compares a smeared energy density to a negative bound:
\[
\bar\rho_g \;\ge\; -\frac{K}{\tau^4},
\]
with \(\bar\rho_g\) a weighted average of a renormalized energy density along a timelike worldline and \(\tau\) the sampling time. citeturn35search35turn2search2 **[Canonical-authoritative]**

A common “margin-like ratio” at threshold 1 can be expressed (for \(\bar\rho_g<0\)) as:
\[
\zeta \;:=\; \frac{|\bar\rho_g|}{K/\tau^4} \;=\; \frac{|\bar\rho_g|\;\tau^4}{K},
\qquad
\text{gate passes if }\zeta \le 1.
\]
This ratio form is implementation-convenient because it is dimensionless when \(K\) carries the correct units. **[Exploratory]**

**Dominant uncertainty terms in \(\bar\rho_g\).** In a codebase that builds \(\bar\rho_g\) from *measured channels* through *representation mappings*, the dominant terms are typically:

1) **Measurement noise (aleatory)** in the base sensor channel \(y(t)\) (e.g., force spectrum, timing jitter, curvature estimate), mapped into a density estimate \(\rho(t)\). **[Exploratory]**

2) **Model-form uncertainty (epistemic)** in the mapping \(M: y \mapsto \rho\). This includes boundary/geometry sensitivity emphasized in curved/bounded settings (because QI applicability depends on boundary and curvature scales). citeturn2search2turn24search6turn11search0 **[Canonical-authoritative]**

3) **Renormalization/scheme uncertainty (epistemic)**: in curved spacetime, \(\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle_{\rm ren}\) is only fixed up to conserved local curvature terms; trace anomaly and counterterm freedoms imply a systematic offset/shape term not captured by a scalar “curvature proxy” unless explicitly modeled. citeturn3search1turn3search6turn24search2 **[Canonical-authoritative]**

4) **Sampling/kernel uncertainty (epistemic + numerical)**: kernel choice and normalization affects \(\bar\rho_g\) and changes \(K\) (constant depends on sampling function class). citeturn2search3turn35search35 **[Canonical-authoritative]**

**Propagation into \(\zeta\).** Using a first-order (log-linear) uncertainty propagation:
\[
\frac{\sigma_\zeta}{\zeta}
\;\approx\;
\sqrt{
\left(\frac{\sigma_{\bar\rho}}{\bar\rho}\right)^2
+
\left(4\frac{\sigma_\tau}{\tau}\right)^2
+
\left(\frac{\sigma_K}{K}\right)^2
+\;2\,\text{Cov terms}
}.
\]
- \(\sigma_{\bar\rho}\) should include both statistical error from sensor noise *and* systematic error from mapping/model/scheme choices.
- \(\sigma_\tau\) must include *clocking jitter* and also *semantic uncertainty* (“which timescale is \(\tau\)?”) if \(\tau\) is derived from other code constructs rather than a declared sampling parameter.
- \(\sigma_K\) is best modeled as a discrete systematic unless the repo binds \(K\) to a field and kernel with an explicit derivation, because \(K\) is not universal across choices. citeturn2search3turn24search0turn35search35 **[Canonical-authoritative]**

**“Could flip decision?” assessment with defensible bounds.** Define the *signed* slack:
\[
S := \bar\rho_g + \frac{K}{\tau^4}.
\]
- Pass condition: \(S\ge 0\).
- A conservative flip test: if \(S\) is within a \(k\sigma_S\) band around 0, the decision is not robust:
\[
|S| \;\le\; k\,\sigma_S \quad\Rightarrow\quad \text{“could flip.”}

Here \(\sigma_S\) must include the same components mapped into \(\sigma_{\bar\rho}, \sigma_\tau, \sigma_K\). **[Exploratory]**

**Canonical robustness conclusion:** the inequality itself is exact under its assumptions, but any implementation using inferred \(\rho\), approximate curvature scales, or ambiguous renormalization conventions must treat near-threshold results as *epistemically fragile* unless those uncertainties are propagated. citeturn24search6turn24search2turn3search1 **[Canonical-authoritative]**

### F) Falsifier checklist (actionable)

Each item below is a concrete falsifier: it can demonstrate that a gate result is not literature-equivalent even if it numerically “passes.”

- **Operator mismatch falsifiers**
  - **F1:** Verify that the input labeled “\(T_{00}\)” (or \(\rho\)) is explicitly typed as \(\langle T_{\mu\nu}u^\mu u^\nu\rangle_{\rm ren}\) for a specified QFT state class (e.g., Hadamard where required). If instead it is (a) classical stress from Einstein inversion, (b) a curvature proxy scalar, or (c) a model energy density without operator meaning, the QI/QEI equivalence is falsified. citeturn35search35turn24search2
  - **F2:** If any pathway uses null-like contractions or near-null sampling but still applies a timelike \(-K/\tau^4\) gate, parity is falsified by the “no null QI in 4D Minkowski” result. citeturn3search0turn24search7

- **Unit conversion mismatch falsifiers**
  - **F3:** Dimensional audit: confirm \(K\) has units (energy density)\(\times\)(time)\(^4\). If \(\rho\) is in \(J/m^3\) and \(\tau\) in seconds, then \(K\) must be in \(J\,s^4/m^3\). Any internal mixed-unit handling (ms vs s) not logged alongside the computed slack \(S\) falsifies reproducibility. citeturn35search35turn2search2
  - **F4:** Natural-units/SI conversion check: if \(K\) is claimed derived from Ford–Roman’s constant \(\sim 3/(32\pi^2)\), verify the conversion introduces the required \(\hbar/c^3\) factor (or an equivalent consistent scheme). If not, equivalence is falsified. citeturn35search35 **[Exploratory]**

- **Sampling normalization mismatch falsifiers**
  - **F5:** Kernel normalization check: log and verify the discrete window implements the same convention as the theoretical inequality (e.g., \(\int g(\tau)\,d\tau=1\) for a weight with dimensions \(1/\text{time}\) vs \(\int g(\tau)^2 d\tau = 1\) for squared-weight formulations). If the implementation uses a different convention but keeps the same \(K\), equivalence is falsified. citeturn2search3turn35search35
  - **F6:** Kernel-shape check: Lorentzian vs Gaussian constants differ; if code uses Gaussian weights but reuses Lorentzian-derived \(K\) (or vice versa) without a source-derived conversion, equivalence is falsified. citeturn2search3turn35search35

- **Curvature-domain mismatch falsifiers**
  - **F7:** Enforce the short-sampling condition: if \(\tau\_states\) is not \(\ll\) curvature and boundary scales (as required for importing flat QI locally), then any flat \(-K/\tau^4\) gating is falsified. citeturn2search2turn24search6
  - **F8:** Boundary sensitivity falsifier: if the environment includes boundaries (conductors, cavities, horizons, interfaces) but the applicability check ignores boundary distance scales, then the “flat-space carryover” premise is falsified. citeturn2search2turn11search0

- **Proxy-vs-renormalized quantity mismatch falsifiers**
  - **F9:** Renormalization scheme tagging: if \(\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle_{\rm ren}\) is used in curved contexts, log the scheme freedom (allowed local curvature counterterms). If the code treats curvature-derived “\(T_{00}\)” as unique and scheme-free, equivalence is falsified by axiomatic renormalization results. citeturn3search1turn3search6turn24search2
  - **F10:** Quantity-type mismatch: if the gate claims to enforce a QEI on \(\rho=\langle T_{\mu\nu}u^\mu u^\nu\rangle\) but the implemented scalar is an “effective energy density” (EED) or other combination, parity is falsified unless the bound is swapped to the correct one (without weakening). citeturn24search5

### G) Minimal research-backed patch guidance

Constraints honored: **no threshold weakening** and **no policy-threshold edits**. Each item is an instrumentation/reporting/equivalence/uncertainty/semantic patch, and each cites **(i)** a source and **(ii)** a falsifier from Section F.

1) **Add a first-class “quantity semantic type” to every gate-evaluated sample and to every gate report.**
   - Implementation: a required enum for the scalar entering the QI/QEI comparison (example values: `ren_expectation_timelike_energy_density`, `classical_proxy_from_curvature`, `model_energy_density_casimir_like`, `effective_energy_density_SEC`, `null_contracted_average`). Reject (or mark “inconclusive”) if the type is not `ren_expectation_timelike_energy_density` when applying a Ford–Roman timelike bound.
   - Why source-backed: Ford–Roman QI is explicitly about the *renormalized expectation value* of \(T_{\mu\nu}u^\mu u^\nu\) along a timelike inertial observer. citeturn35search35turn2search2
   - Falsifier linkage: prevents silent operator mismatch (F1) and null/timelike confusion (F2). citeturn3search0turn24search7
   - Conclusion label: **[Canonical-authoritative]**

2) **Bind \(K\) to a declared field content + sampling function convention, and emit a machine-verifiable provenance string.**
   - Implementation: require configuration fields `field_model` (e.g., “massless minimally coupled scalar, 4D Minkowski”) and `sampling_kernel_definition` (e.g., Lorentzian weight \(g(\tau)=\tau_0/[\pi(\tau^2+\tau_0^2)]\) with \(\int g\,d\tau=1\)). Gate evaluation must print (and store) the matching literature citation and the constant used (symbolic form, not only numeric).
   - Why source-backed: both Ford–Roman and Fewster–Eveson stress that bounds depend on sampling function and field model; there is no universal \(K\). citeturn35search35turn2search3
   - Falsifier linkage: prevents kernel mismatch (F6) and normalization mismatch (F5). citeturn2search3turn35search35
   - Conclusion label: **[Canonical-authoritative]**

3) **Add an explicit “curvature/boundary applicability certificate” to every time window.**
   - Implementation: for each evaluated window, store \(\tau\), the chosen curvature length scale(s), the boundary distance scale(s) if applicable, and the ratios \(\tau/\ell_{\rm curv}\), \(\tau/\ell_{\rm boundary}\). If any ratio exceeds a configured cutoff, *do not silently pass*: mark the QI result as “not literature-applicable” (separate from pass/fail) and require downstream decisions to treat it as non-evidence.
   - Why source-backed: Ford–Roman argue the flat-space bound should only be applied in regions small compared to curvature/boundary scales; Pfenning–Ford derive curvature-dependent corrections and show flat limit only in short sampling time. citeturn2search2turn24search6
   - Falsifier linkage: addresses curvature-domain mismatch (F7) and boundary omission (F8). citeturn24search6turn11search0
   - Conclusion label: **[Canonical-authoritative]**

4) **Introduce uncertainty objects for every measured-to-represented mapping and propagate to a “decision-flip band.”**
   - Implementation: every mapping \(M:y\mapsto \rho\) must return `(rho_hat, sigma_rho, sigma_systematic_components[])`. Gate computation must output \(S=\bar\rho_g+K/\tau^4\) and \(\sigma_S\) and tag decisions by robustness tier (e.g., robust pass if \(S\ge 3\sigma_S\); robust fail if \(S\le -3\sigma_S\); otherwise “could flip”). This does not weaken thresholds; it *tightens evidence requirements* near threshold.
   - Why source-backed: curved-spacetime renormalization freedom and correction terms imply unavoidable systematic components; QSEI/QEI literature distinguishes which scalar is constrained, increasing mapping uncertainty if mis-typed. citeturn24search2turn3search1turn24search5
   - Falsifier linkage: exposes unit mistakes (F3/F4) via inconsistent \(\sigma_S\), and prevents hidden proxy-vs-renormalized mismatches from masquerading as precise evidence (F9/F10). citeturn3search6turn24search5
   - Conclusion label: **[Canonical-authoritative]**

5) **Forbid “null-like” semantics from using timelike QI constants unless explicitly proven equivalent in the chosen theory.**
   - Implementation: if any window is flagged as null-contracted or near-null (e.g., based on kinematic metadata), the timelike Ford–Roman gate path must be disabled and replaced with a “no universal bound available” output unless a distinct bound is configured and cited.
   - Why source-backed: Fewster–Roman show no null QI along null geodesics in 4D Minkowski (unbounded below), which directly falsifies reuse of a timelike \(-K/\tau^4\) gate there. citeturn3search0turn24search7
   - Falsifier linkage: locks out known-inconsistent regime (F2). citeturn3search0
   - Conclusion label: **[Canonical-authoritative]**

6) **Add a renormalization-scheme “capability note” and refuse curvature-proxy values as substitutes for \(\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle_{\rm ren}\) in evidence packs.**
   - Implementation: whenever the input stress-energy is not produced by a locally covariant renormalized QFT computation (i.e., it is a curvature proxy or model stress), tag the result as “representation-only; not QEI evidence.” This is not a pass/fail change; it is an evidence classification change that prevents semantic conflation.
   - Why source-backed: Wald’s axiomatic renormalization and later Hollands–Wald emphasize that \(\langle T_{\mu\nu}\rangle_{\rm ren}\) is defined with constrained but real scheme freedoms (curvature terms, trace anomaly), and is not equivalent to a scalar-inferred classical source. citeturn3search1turn3search6turn24search2
   - Falsifier linkage: directly targets proxy-vs-renormalized mismatch (F9) and operator mismatch (F1). citeturn24search2turn35search35
   - Conclusion label: **[Canonical-authoritative]**
