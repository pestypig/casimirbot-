# TOE-081 Physics Research Brief (Root-Lane Expansion Hardening)

## Context Anchor
This artifact is authored under the constraints in `docs/audits/research/toe-research-context-pack-2026-02-18.md` and treats maturity as an engineering reliability contract, not as physical truth certification.

## Ticket
- ID: `TOE-081-entropy-foundations-root-lane-contract`
- Focus: root-lane expansion for life/cosmology/consciousness and runtime safety prompts
- Objective: make the expanded root→leaf claim set falsifiable and replay-safe

## Scope Boundaries and Non-Claims
### In-scope
- Root-to-leaf path contract hardening for seven manifest paths.
- Deterministic falsifier semantics per path.
- Replay-safe policy behavior for bridge-enabled prompt resolution.

### Out-of-scope
- New physical equations beyond E1..E5 backbone.
- Promotion of any path above `diagnostic` claim tier.
- Physical viability certification or discovery claims about life origin.

### Non-claims
- This brief does **not** prove physical truth of any root-lane narrative.
- This brief does **not** certify independent laboratory reproduction.
- This brief does **not** imply `reduced-order` or `certified` maturity for TOE-081.

## Hypothesis Inventory
1. **H1 — Path completeness hypothesis**
   - If each runtime leaf is covered by explicit root→...→leaf paths with bridge provenance and falsifier fields, unresolved narrative drift is reduced to deterministic validation failures.
2. **H2 — Deterministic reject-rule hypothesis**
   - If every path includes concrete reject rules and threshold semantics, replay order permutations produce stable gate outcomes.
3. **H3 — Uncertainty handling hypothesis**
   - If uncertainty models are explicit (`deterministic_threshold_contract_v1`, `deterministic_contract_gate`, `runtime_gate_thresholds`), diagnostic claims remain auditable under bounded confidence language.
4. **H4 — Safety-lane integrity hypothesis**
   - If runtime-safety paths include citation/maturity/guardrail determinism observables, action-oriented leaves can remain constrained under strict fail posture.

## Equation Backbone Alignment (E1..E5)
- **E1/E2/E3 context anchoring:** root IDs preserve GR/semiclassical/conservation lineage for path narratives.
- **E4 uncertainty propagation:** each path has an uncertainty model identifier as a first-class falsifier field.
- **E5 runtime safety gate:** safety-facing paths include deterministic gate thresholds and strict fail reasons.

## Replay-Safety Design
- All path contracts require deterministic reject rules rather than free-text adjudication.
- Falsifier metadata is embedded per path to prevent implicit defaults.
- Bridge usage is explicit through `dag_bridges[]` to keep cross-domain transitions auditable.
- Tier ceiling remains `diagnostic`; higher-tier interpretation is blocked until stronger evidence contracts are met.

## What Changes Tier Eligibility
Tier eligibility may increase **only** when all of the following become true for a path family:
1. Independent reproduction evidence exists for the path’s observables.
2. Uncertainty model upgrades from deterministic threshold semantics to validated statistical coverage with confidence calibration.
3. Reject rules are validated against out-of-distribution and adversarial replay suites with stable fail precedence.
4. Safety-critical leaves demonstrate sustained low non-200/error rates under production-like load and policy drift checks.
5. Governance updates explicitly raise `claim_tier_ceiling` and are accompanied by audit receipts proving no missing falsifier metadata.

Until these conditions hold, TOE-081 remains `diagnostic` by policy.

## Verification Hooks (Research Lane)
- `npm run validate:physics:root-leaf`
- `npm run audit:toe:preflight`
- `npm run casimir:verify -- --pack repo-convergence --url http://localhost:5173/api/agi/adapter/run --export-url http://localhost:5173/api/agi/training-trace/export --trace-out artifacts/training-trace-root-lane-r1.jsonl --trace-limit 200 --ci`

## Promotion Recommendation
- Recommended claim tier: `diagnostic`
- Rationale: current artifacts establish falsifiability/replay determinism contracts but do not satisfy reduced-order or certified evidence depth requirements.
