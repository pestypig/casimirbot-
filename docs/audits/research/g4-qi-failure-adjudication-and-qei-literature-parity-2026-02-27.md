# G4/QI Failure Adjudication and QI/QEI Literature Parity Report

## A) Executive verdict

- **Canonical-authoritative**: The current G4/QI failure is a **FordRomanQI hard-gate FAIL driven by `G4_QI_MARGIN_EXCEEDED` with `marginRatioRawComputed = 1.0` (exactly on the `< 1` requirement)**, consistently across the canonical campaign waves. fileciteturn43file0L1-L120 fileciteturn44file0L1-L120 fileciteturn46file0L1-L260
- **Canonical-authoritative**: The failure is **floor-dominated**: `boundFloorApplied = true`, `boundUsed_Jm3 == lhs_Jm3`, and the canonical ledger flags the decision class as **`margin_limited`**. fileciteturn44file0L1-L120 fileciteturn43file0L1-L120
- **Canonical-authoritative**: The same canonical artifacts show **`boundComputed_Jm3` orders-of-magnitude less negative than `lhs_Jm3`**, yielding an astronomically large `marginRatioRawComputed` in the computed-only counterfactual; the governance matrix explicitly records a **canonical-vs-computed-only mismatch**. fileciteturn44file0L1-L180
- **Exploratory/counterfactual**: The recovery-search lane primarily exhibits **`applicabilityStatus = UNKNOWN` + `G4_QI_SIGNAL_MISSING`** alongside the same margin edge (`marginRatioRawComputed = 1`), indicating recovery is **signal/applicability limited** even before margin closure. fileciteturn45file0L1-L140 fileciteturn46file0L1-L260
- **Sufficiency for decisive internal judgment**: Evidence is **sufficient** to make a decisive internal judgment on the **proximate failure cause** (margin-limited, floor-dominated, strict `< 1` gate). Evidence is **not yet sufficient** to close all deeper ambiguity about **semantic alignment** of repo `lhs_Jm3` with renormalized QFT energy densities required by QI/QEI theorems. fileciteturn43file0L1-L160 fileciteturn44file0L1-L220 citeturn18view0turn19view2turn13search3

## C) Literature parity table

| Repo construct | Literature analog equation | Expected scaling/units/sign | Consistency verdict (consistent/inconsistent/inconclusive) | Citation(s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `WARP_AGENTS.md` G4 spec: `int_T00_dt >= -K / tau^4` | Worldline QI/QEI structure: **smeared/weighted average of renormalized energy density** bounded below by a negative quantity depending on sampling scale and sampling function. (Fewster–Eveson Eq. (1) defines the smeared energy density; Eq. (3) gives a 4D Minkowski bound for Lorentzian sampling; Pfenning–Ford cite Ford–Roman QI Eq. (9) as the starting point.) | For 4D Minkowski, typical scaling **∝ −1/τ^4**; sign negative; LHS has units of energy density if sampling function is normalized to unit integral (or uses g(t)^2 conventions). | **Consistent** on the **τ power-law** and the “sampling-function–dependent bound” concept; **inconclusive** on unit normalization until repo’s sampling normalization is explicitly evidenced. | fileciteturn41file0L1-L120 citeturn18view0turn19view2 |
| `server/qi/qi-bounds.ts`: bound model `bound_Jm3 = -K / tau^4` (plus implementation-specific adjustments) | General Minkowski QI/QEI families: bounds depend on sampling-function shape and scale; Fewster–Eveson discuss generalized sampling functions and how bounds change relative to Ford–Roman’s Lorentzian choice (Eqs. (1)–(7)). | Dimensional analysis: in 4D, expectation is **energy density bound ∝ 1/τ^4**; changing sampling function alters the constant/function but not necessarily the dominant τ scaling. | **Consistent** on **dimensional scaling**; **inconclusive** on the *constant K* (repo-configured, while literature constants are field- and sampling-specific). | fileciteturn38file0L1-L120 citeturn18view0 |
| Sampling dependence (`samplingKind` repertoire in repo; recovery/parity scripts exercise sampling) | Sampling-function dependence is explicit: Fewster–Eveson define arbitrary admissible smooth sampling functions and compare to Lorentzian (Eq. (2) Lorentzian; Eq. (5) Flanagan’s optimal 2D bound; Eq. (7) general d-dimensional bound for wider classes). | Changing sampling function changes constant factors and can tighten/loosen bounds; 2D scaling is typically ∝ −1/τ^2 (as discussed in Fewster–Eveson around Eqs. (4)–(6)). | **Consistent** if repo treats sampling-family changes as changing constants/shape rather than just relabeling; **inconclusive** until repo’s sampler normalization and admissibility constraints are checked against the theorems’ assumptions. | citeturn18view0 |
| Curvature applicability gating (`curvatureOk`, `curvatureRatio`, `curvatureEnforced`) | Flat-space QI applied to curved spacetimes only on short sampling times: Pfenning–Ford state flat-space application requires sampling time smaller than minimum local radius of curvature (Sec. 1 and Sec. 3 setup; Eq. (20) sets τ relative to curvature scale and parameter σο). Fewster (2004) abstract explicitly says flat-space QEIs approximate curved results on sampling times short compared with natural geometric scales. | Expect **correction terms** in curvature expansion; validity only for τ ≪ local curvature radius; sign and τ scaling approach flat limit as curvature → 0 or τ → 0 relative to curvature scale. | **Consistent** at the level of having an explicit “curvature window” applicability gate; **inconclusive** on whether repo’s `curvatureRatio` matches the literature’s curvature-scale definitions (needs explicit formula + invariants). | fileciteturn46file0L1-L260 citeturn19view0turn19view2turn14search5 |
| Repo `lhs_Jm3` derived from **metric/constraint** sources (`rhoSource` like `warp.metric...`, metric contract metadata) | QI/QEI theorems constrain **renormalized expectation values** of the QFT stress-energy tensor in admissible states (e.g., Fewster–Eveson explicitly use the *renormalized stress-energy tensor* in Eq. (1) and take expectation values; Pfenning–Ford likewise treat ρ as QFT energy density entering QI Eq. (9)). Renormalization requires Hadamard structure for meaningful point-splitting stress-tensor definition (Fulling–Sweeny–Wald 1978). | Repo’s Einstein/metric-derived “effective T00” is not automatically equal to ⟨T00⟩ren of a quantum field state; a consistent mapping requires explicit semiclassical model/state + renormalization prescription. | **Inconsistent / high risk** unless repo explicitly documents the mapping from geometry-derived proxies to ⟨T00⟩ren and verifies the required state conditions (Hadamard, etc.). | citeturn18view0turn19view2turn13search3 |
| `safetySigma_Jm3` subtraction / conservative offsets | Literature sometimes discusses state dependence and curvature corrections, but a fixed “safety sigma” subtraction is not a standard part of QI/QEI statements. Numerical/measurement uncertainty is treated as a separate verification layer (e.g., discretization uncertainty reporting guidance in Celik et al. 2008). | As a numerical guard, subtracting an uncertainty margin is “conservative” in the sense of tightening a lower bound (making it more negative or more stringent depending on sign convention), but it is not a theorem-derived term. | **Inconclusive**: defensible as “engineering conservatism,” but not a direct QI/QEI analog. | fileciteturn38file0L1-L140 citeturn20search6 |

## D) Root-cause split (100%)

**Canonical-authoritative evidence basis**: canonical root artifacts (`artifacts/research/full-solve/*`) and the FordRomanQI implementation/diagnostics path. fileciteturn43file0L1-L200 fileciteturn44file0L1-L220 fileciteturn46file0L1-L260

- **`margin_limited`: 60%**  
  Canonical decision class is explicitly **`margin_limited`**, and canonical waves fail with **`G4_QI_MARGIN_EXCEEDED`** at **`marginRatioRawComputed = 1.0`** with a strict `< 1` requirement in the viability gate. fileciteturn43file0L1-L160 fileciteturn44file0L1-L160 fileciteturn46file0L1-L260

- **`applicability_limited`: 15%**  
  While canonical waves show `applicabilityStatus = PASS`, the recovery-search lane (exploratory) and scan classification indicate that **non-PASS/UNKNOWN applicability and `signal_missing` frequently block recovery**, meaning the broader parameter-space “fix” surface is partially gated by applicability signaling rather than pure margin mechanics. fileciteturn45file0L1-L140 fileciteturn43file0L1-L220 fileciteturn46file0L1-L260

- **`scaling_or_units_risk`: 15%**  
  The computed bound scale (order `10^1 J/m^3`) versus canonical `lhs_Jm3` scale (order `10^19 J/m^3`) is an extreme separation; additionally, literature QI/QEI bounds apply to **renormalized QFT expectation values**, so the mapping from metric-derived quantities to ⟨T00⟩ren is a high-leverage semantic/units risk surface even if internal SI↔geom conversions are self-consistent. fileciteturn44file0L1-L200 fileciteturn42file0L1-L120 citeturn18view0turn19view2turn13search3

- **`semantic/reporting mismatch`: 10%**  
  Canonical governance explicitly records **mismatch with “computed-only” semantics**, and the floor rule producing `boundUsed_Jm3 == lhs_Jm3` forces **`marginRatioRawComputed = 1` mechanically** (a reporting/semantics artifact that makes the margin sit exactly on the boundary even though computed-only would be catastrophically worse). fileciteturn44file0L1-L220

## E) Allowed mitigation matrix (no guardrail weakening)

**Guardrail constraint reminder (non-negotiable)**: FordRomanQI requires **`marginRatio < 1`** with strict congruence/source/contract/curvature conditions when enabled; do not treat equality (`=1`) as pass. fileciteturn46file0L1-L260

| Candidate mitigation | Exact repo surface(s) | Expected directional effect on `lhs_Jm3`, `boundComputed_Jm3`, `marginRatioRawComputed` | Risk to other gates | Falsifier test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Reduce magnitude of negative energy proxy so that floor no longer dominates | Parameter surfaces exercised by campaign/search scripts (e.g., recovery-search parameter families) and the pipeline state assembled before `calculateEnergyPipeline` (warp config inputs). fileciteturn46file0L1-L220 fileciteturn45file0L1-L120 | **`lhs_Jm3`: increase toward 0** (less negative). `boundComputed_Jm3`: unchanged (bound model). `marginRatioRawComputed`: **decrease**; if `|lhs| < |boundComputed|`, then computed margin can drop below 1 and floor can stop triggering. fileciteturn44file0L1-L200 | Could destabilize TS, Theta, mass budget, or GR constraints because many pipeline-derived gates co-vary with warp configuration; may also change curvature ratios and CL3 congruence. fileciteturn46file0L1-L260 | Run full-solve campaign on the changed parameter region and require: (i) `boundFloorApplied=false` OR `boundUsed_Jm3 != lhs_Jm3`, (ii) `marginRatioRawComputed < 1`, (iii) reason code list excludes `G4_QI_MARGIN_EXCEEDED`. Any violation falsifies. fileciteturn43file0L1-L200 |
| Eliminate “signal missing” / applicability UNKNOWN in recovery-search without disabling strictness | Ensure QI source and contract metadata satisfy strict congruence: `rhoSource` is metric/constraint, and metric contract is “ok” in the strict Natário contract checks. fileciteturn46file0L1-L260 | `lhs_Jm3`: unchanged. `boundComputed_Jm3`: unchanged. `marginRatioRawComputed`: unchanged. **But** removes `G4_QI_SIGNAL_MISSING` / `G4_QI_APPLICABILITY_NOT_PASS` failure reasons, narrowing failure to pure margin (allowing margin-focused recovery). fileciteturn46file0L1-L260 | May increase audit strictness exposure: missing chart/observer/normalization fields will now hard-fail; could also impact CL3_RhoDelta gate because it depends on congruence inputs. fileciteturn46file0L1-L260 | In recovery-search outputs, require `applicabilityStatus=PASS` and absence of `G4_QI_SIGNAL_MISSING` across at least one candidate; if none, this mitigation is falsified as insufficient. fileciteturn45file0L1-L140 |
| Curvature-window conformance: ensure τ is inside the “locally flat” regime rather than relying on defaults | Curvature gating and `curvatureRatio` computed in pipeline; strict enforcement toggles reflected in `qiGuardrail.curvatureEnforced/curvatureOk`. fileciteturn46file0L1-L260 | If currently curvature-limited, achieving `curvatureOk=true` flips applicability to PASS and removes curvature reason codes. Does **not** directly reduce margin ratio unless it also changes the sampled stress proxy. fileciteturn46file0L1-L260 | Tightening curvature checks can reduce candidate space and can cause “curvature window” hard fail. Do **not** weaken curvature checks; instead make inputs satisfy them. Literature warns flat-QI-to-curved requires τ ≪ curvature radius. citeturn19view0turn19view2turn14search5 | Require measured `curvatureRatio` and `curvatureOk=true` accompanied by explicit recorded curvature-scale computation; if `curvatureOk` remains undefined/false, mitigation falsified. fileciteturn46file0L1-L260 |
| Numerical verification & discretization convergence around the boundary `marginRatio=1` | Any solver/campaign harness ability to run the same case at multiple resolutions and compare derived curvature and stress proxies; GR constraint evaluation pipeline and reporting surfaces. fileciteturn39file0L1-L120 citeturn20search6 | Goal is **not** to “tune” the result, but to quantify whether `marginRatio` is robustly ≥1 or could be <1 within numerical uncertainty. A verified error bar may show the equality is an artifact of floor semantics rather than numerical noise. | Risk: extra runs are compute-intensive and may reveal additional constraint failures at higher resolution. | Apply a standard discretization-uncertainty protocol (e.g., GCI / Richardson-style extrapolation guidance) and require the final reported uncertainty in `marginRatioRawComputed` be small enough to decide `<1` vs `≥1` without ambiguity; if uncertainty interval straddles 1, the gap is not closed. citeturn20search6 |

## F) Decisive gap-closure checklist

Ranked by expected information gain for adjudication *within the repo’s falsifiable “gates + evidence” framework*:

1. **Expose the exact mathematical definition of repo `lhs_Jm3`** as computed in `server/energy-pipeline.ts`: confirm whether it is (a) a properly normalized sampling integral consistent with QI/QEI assumptions (units J/m³), (b) a time integral (units J/m³·s), or (c) a proxy derived from spatial/metric averaging. This is the single largest ambiguity for literature parity. fileciteturn37file0L1-L60 fileciteturn41file0L1-L120 citeturn18view0turn19view2
2. **Make the policy-floor rule fully auditable**: provide a machine-readable explanation for why `boundPolicyFloor_Jm3` equals `lhs_Jm3` and under exactly what conditions it triggers (including ordering among env/default/fallback floors). This is needed to decide whether the `marginRatio==1` edge is an intended fail-closed semantics or an unintended semantic/reporting artifact. fileciteturn44file0L1-L220 fileciteturn46file0L1-L260
3. **Add a canonical “sampling audit pack” artifact** for each wave: `samplingKind`, effective kernel/weights, `dt`, `∑w`, and the characteristic scale claimed to be `tau`. Literature parity depends on sampling dependence; Fewster–Eveson makes admissibility of sampling functions explicit and connects bounds to the chosen function. citeturn18view0
4. **Curvature applicability audit**: emit the curvature invariant(s) used, the curvature length scale estimate, and the derived `curvatureRatio` used to set `curvatureOk`. Pfenning–Ford explicitly treats the ratio of sampling time to local curvature radius as controlling corrections/validity. citeturn19view0turn19view2turn14search5
5. **State/renormalization mapping evidence**: if repo intends metric-derived T00 as a stand-in for ⟨T00⟩ren, provide documented mapping and state assumptions (Hadamard condition, renormalization prescription). Fulling–Sweeny–Wald show why a Hadamard singularity structure is required for point-splitting renormalization to be well-defined. citeturn13search3turn13search1
6. **Discretization uncertainty report for curvature/stress-derived quantities**: adopt a standard uncertainty reporting protocol (e.g., ASME-style discretization uncertainty guidance) to quantify whether any inferred curvature/stress proxy is numerically stable. citeturn20search6

## G) Final boundary statement

This campaign defines falsifiable reduced-order full-solve gates and reproducible evidence requirements; it is not a physical warp feasibility claim.
