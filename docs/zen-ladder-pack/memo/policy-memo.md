# Entrepreneur Ladder and Curiosity Dividend
A values-to-workflows program design for legible, auditable opportunity

## Executive summary
This proposal defines a national Entrepreneur Ladder that turns business support into staged, auditable workflows. Each rung converts values into explicit artifacts, checks, and gates that must be satisfied before eligibility or funding advances. A separate Curiosity Dividend funds verified exploration and public goods without weakening the ladder's integrity and safety floor.

The design is composable, inspectable, and resistant to capture: every decision produces a receipt, rules are legible, and high-impact decisions require two-key approval and verification loops.

## Problem
Aspiring entrepreneurs face a steep $5k to $100k cliff. Early risk is high, access to insider capital is uneven, and support programs are often opaque or captured. When rules are unclear, fear and insider advantage dominate. When rules are too heavy, bureaucracy prevents legitimate experimentation.

## Design principles
1. Integrity and safety are a floor. Demand cannot override non-harm, transparency, or redress.
2. Legibility beats vibes. Criteria are explicit, measurable, and auditable.
3. Support matches uncertainty. Early rungs fund exploration; later rungs fund scaling.
4. Anti-capture is built in. COI disclosure, fee caps, audit sampling, and revocation paths are mandatory.
5. Programs sunset by default. Review cycles and expiration prevent permanent empires.

## Mechanism: the ladder as staged workflows
Each rung is a workflow with required evidence, checks, and gates. Applicants are evaluated on four universal axes:
- Demand reality
- Capability
- Integrity and safety
- Sustainability

A pre-rung societal eligibility gate enforces the Zen handrails before any scoring happens. Demand cannot override safety or integrity.

### Summary of rungs
- R0 Orientation: turn an idea into a checkable plan.
- R1 Proof of problem: verify the pain and the segment.
- R2 Prototype and pilot: prove reliable delivery.
- R3 Traction: prove repeat demand, not one-time excitement.
- R4 Early growth: expand without breaking safety or quality.
- R5 Scale: grow into stable employment without capture.
- R6 Graduation: transition to durable competitiveness.

## Curiosity Dividend: funding verified exploration
Curiosity Dividend rewards verified exploration that produces public goods:
- reproducible benchmarks
- documented replications
- published corrections or negative results
- datasets with privacy discipline
- methods and tooling improvements

Curiosity receipts are additive. They unlock credits or extensions but never substitute for demand or integrity thresholds.

## Governance and safeguards
- Receipts: every decision emits a receipt with checks, evidence, approvals, and timestamps.
- Appeals: every denial includes a clear fail reason and an appeal path.
- Audits: risk-weighted sampling with revocation triggers for fraud or harm.
- Two-key approval: public claims and high-impact decisions require two independent signoffs.

## Role of AI
AI assists but does not judge:
- generate checklists from WorkflowSpec
- flag missing evidence or contradictions
- summarize submissions with sources linked
- propose next experiments

Final decisions, enforcement actions, and revocations remain human and auditable.

## Utility report
Utility is defined operationally as:
- check pass rates
- evidence freshness
- review cadence adherence
- rung transition outcomes
- incident and correction rates

A public utility report discloses aggregate performance without exposing private applicant details.

## Risks and mitigations
- Bureaucracy creep: keep checks few and measurable; use risk-based audits.
- Capture: require COI disclosure, transparency, and random audits.
- Curiosity gaming: enforce verification, expiry, and non-substitution rules.

## Pilot plan
1. Ship the workflow registry and validator.
2. Run a small R0-R2 pilot with receipts and public utility reporting.
3. Expand to R3-R6 with two-key gates and audit sampling.

Conclusion: this design keeps ambition welcome while making predation and capture structurally hard.
