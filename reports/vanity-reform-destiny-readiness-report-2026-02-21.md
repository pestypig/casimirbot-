| 9 | HEAD | done | Final readiness/reporting synthesis and ledger closure. |

## Blockers and unknown evidence items

- No hard blockers remain for this wave.
- Existing repository-wide TypeScript baseline issues still affect `npm run check` outside prompt scope; prompt-specific tests and Casimir gates passed for this run.
- Unknown queue items from evidence ledger remain open for later maturity promotion (citation normalization, endpoint auth/tenant policy, persistence policy for pressure telemetry, false-positive policy).

## Maturity and decision

- Current maturity remains **diagnostic/reduced-order**.
- Decision for next wave: **GO (guarded)**.
- Why: all prompt scopes were implemented with deterministic checks and PASS Casimir verification, while preserving agency invariants and verification-first behavior.

## Final Casimir block

- verdict: PASS
- firstFail: none
