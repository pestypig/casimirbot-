# Helix Ask Stellar Equation Framework Build Pass

## Scope and guardrails
- Built a repository-grounded framework for equation/claim targets from the attached Stellar Consciousness review.
- Maintained maturity discipline: consciousness linkage remains exploratory unless repo evidence provides stronger status.
- Applied anchor set: docs + tree schemas + ideology bridge + WARP constraints.
- Provenance warning: requested PDF path `docs/papers/stellar-consciousness-orch-or-review-full.pdf` could not be materialized from local filesystem because the source attachment file was not present as a direct file.

## Anchor coverage
All required anchors were loaded and used for mapping, schema alignment, and maturity policy:
1. docs/stellar-consciousness-ii.md
2. docs/stellar-consciousness-orch-or-review.md
3. docs/knowledge/dag-node-schema.md
4. docs/knowledge/physics/math-tree.json
5. docs/knowledge/physics/math-maturity-stages.md
6. docs/knowledge/physics/physics-foundations-tree.json
7. docs/knowledge/bridges/ideology-physics-bridge-tree.json
8. docs/ethos/ideology.json
9. WARP_AGENTS.md

## Top equation families extracted
- OR timescale: `tau ~= hbar / E_G`
- Time-energy relation: `E = hbar / t`
- Uncertainty/tunneling: `Delta E Delta t >= hbar/2`
- Box quantization: `E_j = (pi^2*hbar^2*j^2)/(2 m a^2)`
- London interaction: `V = -C/r^6`
- CSL/dCSL stochastic evolution (mass-density coupling)
- Gaussian-smearing kernel for mass density
- Lorentzian noise-spectrum family
- Stellar scaling (Jeans + mass-luminosity)
- Parker wind momentum/pressure forms

## Congruence posture
- Physics-consistent families map to existing foundations nodes (uncertainty, scaling, constants, no-feasibility-claims).
- Orch-OR consciousness transfer claims are partial/missing in current tree/DAG representation and are therefore held as exploratory.
- Missing bridges backlog defines exact node IDs and edge semantics for next patch.

## No-overclaim statement
No certified-physics claim is made for the consciousness-transfer thesis in this pass. Those claims remain exploratory pending dedicated evidence and tests.
